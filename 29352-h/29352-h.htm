<h3>PHIDIAS<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1" title="Go to footnote 1"><span class="smaller">[1]</span></a><br>

By <span class="smcap">Clarence Cook</span><br>

(ABOUT 500-432 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>)</h3>


<p>Phidias, one of the greatest sculptors the world has seen, and whose
name has become, as it were, the synonym of his art, was born at Athens
about 500 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> He belonged to a family of artists, none of whom indeed
were distinguished in their profession, but their varied occupations
furnished the atmosphere in which such a talent as that of Phidias could
best be fostered and brought to maturity. His father was Charmides, who
is believed to have been an artist, because the Greeks, in their
inscriptions, did not associate the name of the father with that of the
son unless both were of the same calling. A brother of Phidias,
Pan&oelig;nos, was a painter, and is mentioned among those artists, twenty
or more in number, who in conjunction with Polygnotus, one of the chief
painters of his day, were employed in the decoration of the P&oelig;cile or
Painted Portico, one of the many beautiful buildings erected by Cimon.
The P&oelig;cile was simply a long platform, with a roof supported by a row
of columns on one side and by a wall on the other. It was called "the
painted," because the wall at the back was covered with a series of
large historical pictures containing many figures, and recording some of
the chief events of the time, together with others relating to an
earlier and more shadowy epoch. The subject of the painting, executed,
at least in part, by the brother of Phidias, was the Battle of Marathon,
in which great event it is thought he may himself have taken part.</p>

<p>The boyhood of Phidias fell in a time of national revival, when under
the influence of an ennobling political excitement, all the arts were
quickened to a fresh, original, and splendid growth. The contest between
the Greeks and Persians, which had begun with the Ionian revolt, was in
full activity at the time of his birth. He was ten years old when the
battle of Marathon was fought, and when he was twenty, four of the most
striking events in the history of Greece were crowded into a single
year; the battle of Thermopylæ, the victory at Salamis, and the twin
glories of Platæa and Mycale. His early youth, therefore, was nourished
by the inspiring influences that come from the victorious struggle of a
people to maintain their national life. He was by no means the only
sculptor of his time whom fame remembers, but he alone, rejecting
trivial themes, consecrated his talent to the nobler subjects of his
country's religious <span class="pagenum"><a id="page204" name="page204"></a>(p. 204)</span> life and the ideal conception of her
protecting gods. No doubt, Phidias, like all who are born with the
artistic temperament, would be interested from childhood in the progress
of the splendid works with which Athens was enriching herself under the
rule of Cimon. But his interest must have been greatly increased by the
fact that his brother Pan&oelig;nos was actively engaged in the decoration
of one of those buildings. It would be natural that he should be often
drawn to the place where his brother was at work, and that the sight of
so many artists, most of them young men, filled with the generous ardor
of youth, and inspired by the nature of their task, should have stirred
in him an answering enthusiasm. It gives us a thrill of pleasure to read
in the list of these youths the name of the great tragic poet,
Euripides, who began life as a painter, and in whose plays we find more
than one reference to the art. It cannot be thought unreasonable to
suppose that two such intelligences as these must have had an attraction
for one another, and that, as in the case of Dante and Giotto, the great
poet and the great artist would be drawn together by a likeness in their
taste and aims.</p>

<p>Phidias studied his art first at Athens, with a native sculptor, Hegias,
of whom we know nothing except from books. Later, he went to Argos, and
there put himself under the instruction of Ageladas, a worker chiefly in
bronze, and very famous in his time, of whom, however, nothing remains
but the memory of a few of his more notable works. For us, his own works
forgotten, he remains in honor as the teacher of Myron, of Polycletus,
and of Phidias, the three chief sculptors of the next generation to his
own. On leaving the workshop of Ageladas, Phidias executed several
statues that brought him prominently before the public. For Delphi, he
made a group of thirteen figures in bronze, to celebrate the battle of
Marathon and apotheosize the heroes of Attica. In this group, Miltiades
was placed in the centre, between Athena, the tutelary goddess of
Athens, and Apollo, the guardian of Delphi; while on each side were five
Athenian heroes, Theseus and Codrus with others, arranged in a
semicircle. This important work was paid for by Athens out of her share
in the spoils of Marathon. Another important commission executed by
Phidias was a statue of Athena made for her temple at Platæa, and paid
for with the eighty talents raised by the contributions of the other
Grecian states as a reward for the splendid services of the Platæans at
Marathon, where they played somewhat the same part as the Prussians at
the battle of Waterloo. The head, hands, and feet of this statue were of
marble, but the drapery was of gold; so arranged, probably, as in the
case of the great statue of Athena designed later by Phidias for the
Parthenon, as to be removable from the marble core at pleasure. Phidias
made so many statues of the virgin goddess Athena, that his name became
associated with hers, as at a later day that of Raphael was with the
Virgin Mary. In the first period of his artistic career, moved perhaps
by his patriotic gratitude for her intervention in behalf of his native
state, he had represented the goddess as a warlike divinity, as here at
Platæa; but in his later conceptions, as in a statue made for the
Athenians of Lemnos, Athena appeared invested with milder attributes,
and with a graceful and winning type of beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page205" name="page205"></a>(p. 205)</span> In their invasion of Attica the Persians had destroyed the city
of Athens, and the people, who had fled to all quarters of the peninsula
to seek refuge from the enemy, returned after the victory at Salamis and
the flight of the Persians, to find their homes a heap of ruins. The
dwelling-houses of the Greeks were everywhere, even in their largest
cities, built of mean materials: walls of stubble overlaid with stucco
and gayly painted. It was not long, therefore, before Athens resumed
something of her old appearance, with such improvements as always follow
the rebuilding of a city. The most important change effected was that
brought about in the character of the great plateau, the fortified rock
of the Acropolis. Here, as in many Greek cities, the temples of the gods
had been erected, and about them, as about the cathedrals of the Middle
Ages, there had grown up a swarm of houses and other buildings built by
generations of people who sought there at once the protection of the
stockade which enclosed the almost inaccessible site, and the still
further safeguard of the presence of the divinities in their temples.
The destructive hand of the Persian invaders had swept this platform
clear of all these multiplied incumbrances, and in the rebuilding of the
city it was determined to reserve the Acropolis for military and
religious uses alone.</p>

<p>The work of improvement was begun by Cimon, who, however, confined his
attention chiefly to the lower city that clustered about the base of the
Acropolis. Here, among other structures, he built the temple of Theseus
and the Painted Portico, and he also erected, near the summit of the
Acropolis, on the western side, the little gem-like temple of the
Wingless Victory, Nike Apteros, in commemoration of the success of the
Athenian arms at the battle of the Eurymedon. It was from Cimon that
Phidias received his first commission for work upon the Acropolis, where
later he was to build such a lasting monument to his own fame and to the
fame of his native land. The commission given him by Cimon was to erect
a bronze statue of Athena which was to stand on the citadel, at once a
symbol of the power of Athens and a tribute to the protecting goddess of
the city. The work upon the statue was probably begun under Cimon, but
according to Ottfried Müller it was not completed at the death of
Phidias. It stood in the open air, and nearly opposite the Colonnade at
the entrance of the great flight of marble steps that led from the plain
to the summit of the Acropolis, and was the first object to meet the eye
on passing through the gateway. It represented the goddess, armed, and
in a warlike attitude, from which it derived its name, Athena Promachos:
Athena, the leader of the battle. With its pedestal it stood about
seventy feet high, towering above the roof of the Parthenon, the gilded
point of the brazen spear held by the goddess flashing back the sun to
the ships as in approaching Athens they rounded the promontory of
Sunium. We read that the statue was still standing so late as 395 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>,
and it is said that its towering height and threatening aspect caused a
panic terror in Alaric and his horde of barbarians when they climbed the
Acropolis to plunder its temple of its treasure.</p>

<p>But it was under the rule of Pericles that Phidias was to find at Athens
his richest employment. Pericles had determined, probably by the advice
of Phidias, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name="page206"></a>(p. 206)</span> to make the Acropolis the seat and centre of the
new and splendid city that was to arise under his administration. The
first great undertaking was the building of a temple to Athena
Parthenos, Athena the Virgin, a design believed to have been suggested
to Pericles by Phidias. The plans were intrusted to Ictinus, an
Athenian, one of the best architects of the day; but the general control
and superintendence of the work were given to Phidias. As the building
rose to completion, workmen in all branches of the arts flocked to
Athens from every part of Greece and were given full employment by
Phidias in the decoration and furnishing of the temple.</p>

<p>The taste of Phidias controlled the whole scheme of decoration applied
to the building, into which color entered, no doubt, to a much greater
extent than was formerly believed. Even after time and the destructive
hand of man have done their worst, there still remain sufficient traces
of color to prove that the sculpture, and the whole upper part of the
temple, were painted in bright but harmonious colors, and that metal
ornaments and accessories accented the whole scheme with glittering
points of light reflected from their shining surfaces.</p>

<p>The sculptures with which the Parthenon was adorned by Phidias, and
which were executed under his immediate superintendence, consisted of
two great groups that filled the eastern and western pediments; of
groups of two figures each in the ninety-two metopes or panels above the
outer row of columns; and, finally, the famous frieze that ran
completely round the temple itself, just below the ceiling of the
colonnade, and at a height of about thirty-nine feet from the floor.</p>

<p>The subject of the group that filled the eastern pediment, the one above
the entrance door of the temple, was the birth of Athena. Just how the
event was represented we do not know because quite half the group,
including the principal figures, disappeared very early in our era, and
no description of them remains in any ancient or modern writer. The
group in the western pediment represented the contest between Athena and
Poseidon for the dominion over Attica. According to the legend, the
strife between the two divinities took place in an assembly of the gods
on the Acropolis, who were to determine which of the two contestants
should be the protector of the city. To prove his power, Poseidon struck
the rock with his trident, and a salt spring leaped forth, as if the sea
itself had obeyed the call of its lord. Athena struck the ground, and an
olive-tree sprang up, the emblem of peace and of the victories of
commerce, and the assembly awarded the prize to her. The goddess having
thus received the sovereignty of Athens, it was but natural that a day
should be set apart for her special honor, and a festival instituted to
commemorate the great event. This was the greater Panathenaia, or All
Athenians Day, which was celebrated every fourth year in honor of the
goddess, and which, as its name implies, was taken part in by all the
people of the city. It occurred in the early summer and lasted five
days. On the fifth day, it closed with a procession which went through
all the chief streets of the city and wound its way up the Great
Stairway to the Acropolis, bearing the <i>peplos</i> or embroidered robe
woven by young virgin ladies of Athens, chosen from the highest
families, and known for their skill in this <span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207"></a>(p. 207)</span> kind of work. After
the <i>peplos</i> had been consecrated in the temple it was placed with due
solemnities upon the ancient and venerable figure of the goddess, made
of olive-wood, and said to have descended from heaven. From its subject,
which thus celebrates the Panathenaic procession, the frieze is often
called the Panathenaic frieze.</p>

<p>It is carved from Pentelic marble, of which material the marble building
is constructed. Its original length, running as it did around the entire
building, was 522.80 feet, of which about 410 feet remain. Of this
portion, 249 feet are in the British Museum in slabs and fragments; the
remainder is chiefly in the Louvre, with scattered fragments in other
places. As a connected subject this was the most extensive piece of
sculpture ever made in Greece. From all that can be gathered from the
study of the fragments that remain, the design of the frieze was of the
utmost simplicity and characterized by the union of perfect taste and
clear purpose that marks all the work of the great sculptor. The subject
begins in the frieze at the western end of the temple, where we watch
the assembling of the procession. It then proceeds along the northern
and southern sides of the building, in what we are to suppose one
continuous line, moving toward the east, since all the faces are turned
that way; and at the eastern end, directly over the main entrance to the
building, the two parts of the procession meet, in the presence of the
magistrates and of the divinities who had places of worship in Athens.</p>

<p>Of the grace, the skill in arrangement, the variety of invention, the
happy union of movement and repose shown in this work, not only
artists&mdash;men best fitted to judge its merits from a technical point of
view&mdash;but the cultivated portion of the public, and a large and
ever-increasing circle of every-day people, have by common consent
agreed in praise. By the multiplication of casts, to be found now in all
our principal museums, we are enabled to study and to enjoy the long
procession even better than it could have been enjoyed in its original
place, where it must have been seen at a great disadvantage in spite of
the skill shown by Phidias in adapting it to its site; for, as the
frieze stood thirty-nine feet from the floor, and as the width of the
portico between the wall and the columns was only nine feet, it was seen
at a very sharp angle, and owing to the projection of the roof beyond
the wall of the temple the frieze received only reflected light from the
marble pavement below.</p>

<p>Apart from the marble sculptures on the exterior of the Parthenon, the
two most famous works of Phidias were the statues of Athena, made for
the interior of the Parthenon, and of Zeus for the temple of the god at
Olympia in Elis. Both these statues were of the sort called
<i>Chryselephantine</i>, from the Greek <i>chrousous</i>, golden, and
<i>elephantinos</i>, of ivory; that is, they were constructed of plates of
gold and ivory, laid upon a core of wood or stone. The style was not
new, though its invention was at one time ascribed to Phidias. It came
from the East, but it was now employed for the first time in Greece in a
work of national importance.</p>

<p>In the Athena, the face, neck, arms, hands, and feet were made of
ivory, and the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name="page208"></a>(p. 208)</span> drapery and ornaments, the helmet, the shield,
and the sandals of gold, which as in the case of the statue made for
Platæa, was removable at pleasure. The height of the statue, including
the pedestal, was nearly forty feet. The goddess stood erect, clothed
with a tunic reaching to the ankles, and showing her richly sandalled
feet. She had the ægis on her breast, her head was covered with a
helmet, and her shield, richly embossed with the Battle of the Amazons,
rested on the ground at her side. In one hand she held a spear, and in
the other, an image of Victory six feet high.</p>

<p>A still more splendid work, and one which raised the fame of Phidias to
the highest point, was the statue of the Olympian Zeus, made for the
Eleans. In this statue, Phidias essayed to embody the Homeric ideal of
the supreme divinity of the people of Greece sitting on his throne as a
monarch, and in an attitude of majestic repose. The throne, made of
cedar-wood, was covered with plates of gold, and enriched with ivory,
ebony, and precious stones. It rested on a platform twelve feet high,
made of costly marble and carved with the images of the gods who formed
the council of Zeus on Olympus. The feet of the god rested on a
footstool supported by lions, and with the combat of Theseus and the
Amazons in a bas-relief on the front and sides. In one hand Zeus held
the sceptre, and in the other a winged Victory. His head was crowned
with a laurel wreath; his mantle, falling from one shoulder, left his
breast bare and covered the lower part of his person with its ample
folds of pure gold enamelled with flowers. The whole height of the
statue with the pedestal was about fifty feet; by its very disproportion
to the size of the temple it was made to appear still larger than it
really was. This statue was reckoned one of the wonders of the world. In
it the Greeks seemed to behold Zeus face to face. To see it was a cure
for all earthly woes, and to die without having seen it was reckoned a
great calamity.</p>

<p>The downfall of Pericles, due to the jealousies of his rivals, carried
with it the ruin of Phidias, his close friend, to whom he had entrusted
such great undertakings. An indictment was brought against the sculptor,
charging him with appropriating to himself a portion of the gold given
him for the adornment of the statue of Athena; and according to some
authorities Pericles himself was included in the charge. The gold had,
however, been attached to the statue in such a manner that it could be
taken off and weighed, and in the proof, the charge had to be abandoned.
But Phidias did not escape so easily. He was accused of sacrilege in
having introduced portraits of himself and Pericles on the shield of the
goddess, where, says Plutarch, in the bas-relief of the Battle of the
Amazons, he carved his own portrait as a bald old man lifting a stone
with both hands, and also introduced an excellent likeness of Pericles
fighting with an Amazon.</p>

<p>Phidias died in prison before the trial came off, and his name must be
added to the long list of those whom an ungrateful world has rewarded
for their services with ignominy and death.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

</div>

<p>Leonardo da Vinci seems to present in his own person a <i>résumé</i> of all
the characteristics of the age in which he lived. He was <i>the</i> miracle
of that age of miracles. Ardent and versatile as youth; patient and
persevering as age; a most profound and original thinker; the greatest
mathematician and most ingenious mechanic of his time; architect,
chemist, engineer, musician, poet, painter&mdash;we are not only astounded by
the variety of his natural gifts and acquired knowledge, but by the
practical direction of his amazing powers. The extracts which have been
published from MSS. now existing in his own handwriting show him to have
anticipated by the force of his own intellect some of the greatest
discoveries made since his time. "These fragments," says Mr. Hallam,
"are, according to our common estimate of the age in which he lived,
more like revelations of physical truths vouchsafed to a single mind
than the superstructure of its reasoning upon any established basis. The
discoveries which made Galileo, Kepler, Castelli, and other names
illustrious; the system of Copernicus, the very theories of recent
geologists, are anticipated by Da Vinci within the compass of a few
pages, not perhaps in the most precise language, or on the most
conclusive reasoning, but so as to strike us with something like the awe
of preternatural knowledge. In an age of so much dogmatism he first laid
down the grand principle of Bacon, that experiment and observation must
be the guides to just theory in the investigation of nature. If any
doubt could be harbored, not as to the right of Leonardo da Vinci to
stand as the first name of the fifteenth century, which is beyond all
doubt, but as to his originality in so many discoveries, which probably
no one man, especially in such circumstances, has ever made, it must be
by an hypothesis not very untenable, that some parts of physical science
had already attained a height which mere books do not record."</p>

<p>It seems at first sight almost incomprehensible that, thus endowed as a
philosopher, mechanic, inventor, discoverer, the fame of Leonardo should
now rest on the works he has left as a painter. We cannot, within these
limits, attempt to explain why and how it is that as the man of science
he has been naturally and necessarily left behind by the onward march
of intellectual progress, while as the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page210" name="page210"></a>(p. 210)</span> poet-painter he still
survives as a presence and a power. We must proceed at once to give some
account of him in the character in which he exists to us and for
us&mdash;that of the great artist.</p>

<p>Leonardo was born at Vinci, near Florence, in the Lower Val d'Arno, on
the borders of the territory of Pistoia. His father, Piero da Vinci, was
an advocate of Florence&mdash;not rich, but in independent circumstances, and
possessed of estates in land. The singular talents of his son induced
Piero to give him, from an early age, the advantage of the best
instructors. As a child he distinguished himself by his proficiency in
arithmetic and mathematics. Music he studied early, as a science as well
as an art. He invented a species of lyre for himself, and sung his own
poetical compositions to his own music, both being frequently
extemporaneous. But his favorite pursuit was the art of design in all
its branches; he modelled in clay or wax, or attempted to draw every
object which struck his fancy. His father sent him to study under Andrea
Verrocchio, famous as a sculptor, chaser in metal, and painter. Andrea,
who was an excellent and correct designer, but a bad and hard colorist,
was soon after engaged to paint a picture of the baptism of our Saviour.
He employed Leonardo, then a youth, to execute one of the angels; this
he did with so much softness and richness of color, that it far
surpassed the rest of the picture; and Verrocchio from that time threw
away his palette, and confined himself wholly to his works in sculpture
and design, "enraged," says Vessari, "that a child should thus excel
him."</p>

<p>The youth of Leonardo thus passed away in the pursuit of science and of
art; sometimes he was deeply engaged in astronomical calculations and
investigations; sometimes ardent in the study of natural history,
botany, and anatomy; sometimes intent on new effects of color, light,
shadow, or expression in representing objects animate or inanimate.
Versatile, yet persevering, he varied his pursuits, but he never
abandoned any. He was quite a young man when he conceived and
demonstrated the practicability of two magnificent projects: one was to
lift the whole of the church of San Giovanni, by means of immense
levers, some feet higher than it now stands, and thus supply the
deficient elevation; the other project was to form the Arno into a
navigable canal as far as Pisa, which would have added greatly to the
commercial advantages of Florence.</p>

<p>It happened about this time that a peasant on the estate of Piero da
Vinci brought him a circular piece of wood, cut horizontally from the
trunk of a very large old fig-tree, which had been lately felled, and
begged to have something painted on it as an ornament for his cottage.
The man being an especial favorite, Piero desired his son Leonardo to
gratify his request; and Leonardo, inspired by that wildness of fancy
which was one of his characteristics, took the panel into his own room,
and resolved to astonish his father by a most unlooked-for proof of his
art. He determined to compose something which should have an effect
similar to that of the Medusa on the shield of Perseus, and almost
petrify beholders. Aided by his recent studies in natural history, he
collected together from the neighboring swamps and the river-mud all
kinds of hideous reptiles, as adders, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name="page211"></a>(p. 211)</span> lizards, toads, serpents:
insects, as moths, locusts, and other crawling and flying obscene and
obnoxious things; and out of these he composed a sort of monster or
chimera, which he represented as about to issue from the shield, with
eyes flashing fire, and of an aspect so fearful and abominable that it
seemed to infect the very air around. When finished, he led his father
into the room in which it was placed, and the terror and horror of Piero
proved the success of his attempt. This production, afterward known as
the "Rotello del Fico," from the material on which it was painted, was
sold by Piero secretly for one hundred ducats to a merchant, who carried
it to Milan, and sold it to the duke for three hundred. To the poor
peasant, thus cheated of his "Rotello," Piero gave a wooden shield, on
which was painted a heart transfixed by a dart, a device better suited
to his taste and comprehension. In the subsequent troubles of Milan,
Leonardo's picture disappeared, and was probably destroyed as an object
of horror by those who did not understand its value as a work of art.</p>

<p>During this first period of his life, which was wholly passed in
Florence and its neighborhood, Leonardo painted several other pictures
of a very different character, and designed some beautiful cartoons of
sacred and mythological subjects, which showed that his sense of the
beautiful, the elevated, and the graceful was not less a part of his
mind than that eccentricity and almost perversion of fancy which made
him delight in sketching ugly, exaggerated caricatures, and representing
the deformed and the terrible.</p>

<p>Leonardo da Vinci was now about thirty years old, in the prime of his
life and talents. His taste for pleasure and expense was, however, equal
to his genius and indefatigable industry; and anxious to secure a
certain provision for the future, as well as a wider field for the
exercise of his various talents, he accepted the invitation of Ludovico
Sforza il Moro, then regent, afterward Duke of Milan, to reside in his
court, and to execute a colossal equestrian statue of his ancestor,
Francesco Sforza. Here begins the second period of his artistic career,
which includes his sojourn at Milan, that is from 1483 to 1499.</p>

<p>Vasari says that Leonardo was invited to the court of Milan for the Duke
Ludovico's amusement, "as a musician and performer on the lyre, and as
the greatest singer and <i>improvisatore</i> of his time;" but this is
improbable. Leonardo, in his long letter to that prince, in which he
recites his own qualifications for employment, dwells chiefly on his
skill in engineering and fortification; and sums up his pretensions as
an artist in these few brief words: "I understand the different modes of
sculpture in marble, bronze, and terra-cotta. In painting, also, I may
esteem myself equal to anyone, let him be who he may." Of his musical
talents he makes no mention whatever, though undoubtedly these, as well
as his other social accomplishments, his handsome person, his winning
address, his wit and eloquence, recommended him to the notice of the
prince, by whom he was greatly beloved, and in whose service he remained
for about seventeen years. It is not necessary, nor would it be possible
here, to give a particular account of all the works in which Leonardo
was engaged for his patron, nor of the great political events in which
he was involved, more by his position than <span class="pagenum"><a id="page212" name="page212"></a>(p. 212)</span> by his inclination;
for instance, the invasion of Italy by Charles VIII. of France, and the
subsequent invasion of Milan by Louis XII., which ended in the
destruction of the Duke Ludovico. The greatest work of all, and by far
the grandest picture which, up to that time, had been executed in Italy,
was the "Last Supper," painted on the wall of the refectory, or
dining-room, of the Dominican convent of the Madonna delle Grazie. It
occupied Leonardo about two years, from 1496 to 1498.</p>

<p>The moment selected by the painter is described in the 26th chapter of
St. Matthew, 21st and 22d verses: "And as they did eat, he said, Verily,
I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me: and they were exceeding
sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?"
The knowledge of character displayed in the heads of the different
apostles is even more wonderful than the skilful arrangement of the
figures and the amazing beauty of the workmanship. The space occupied by
the picture is a wall twenty-eight feet in length and the figures are
larger than life.</p>

<p>Of this magnificent creation of art, only the mouldering remains are now
visible. It has been so often repaired that almost every vestige of the
original painting is annihilated; but from the multiplicity of
descriptions, engravings, and copies that exist, no picture is more
universally known and celebrated. Perhaps the best judgment we can now
form of its merits is from the fine copy executed by one of Leonardo's
best pupils, Marco Uggione, for the Certosa at Pavia, and now in London,
in the collection of the Royal Academy. Eleven other copies, by various
pupils of Leonardo, painted either during his lifetime or within a few
years after his death, while the picture was in perfect preservation,
exist in different churches and collections.</p>

<p>While engaged on the Cenacolo, Leonardo painted the portrait of Lucrezia
Crivelli, now in the Louvre (No. 483). It has been engraved under the
title of <i>La Belle Ferronnière</i>, but later researches leave us no doubt
that it represents Lucrezia Crivelli, a beautiful favorite of Ludovico
Sforza, and was painted at Milan in 1497. It is, as a work of art, of
such extraordinary perfection that all critical admiration is lost in
wonder.</p>

<p>Of the grand equestrian statue of Francesco Sforza, Leonardo never
finished more than the model in clay, which was considered a
masterpiece. Some years afterward (in 1499), when Milan was invaded by
the French, it was used as a target by the Gascon bowmen, and completely
destroyed. The profound anatomical studies which Leonardo made for this
work still exist.</p>

<img src="images/img003.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" title="">
<p>Raphael Introduced to Da Vinci.</p>
</div>

<p>In the year 1500, the French being in possession of Milan, his patron
Ludovico in captivity, and the affairs of the state in utter confusion,
Leonardo returned to his native Florence, where he hoped to re-establish
his broken fortunes, and to find employment. Here begins the third
period of his artistic life, from 1500 to 1513, that is, from his
forty-eighth to his sixtieth year. He found the Medici family in exile,
but was received by Pietro Soderini (who governed the city as
"<i>Gonfaloniêre perpetuo</i>") with great distinction, and a pension was
assigned to him as painter in the service of the republic. One of his
first works <span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213"></a>(p. 213)</span> after his return to Florence was the famous
portrait of Madonna Lisa del Giocondo, called in French <i>La Joconde</i>,
and now in the Louvre (484), which after the death of Leonardo was
purchased by Francis I. for 4,000 gold crowns, equal to 45,000 francs or
£1,800, an enormous sum in those days; yet who ever thought it too much?</p>

<p>Then began the rivalry between Leonardo and Michael Angelo, which lasted
during the remainder of Leonardo's life. The difference of age (for
Michael Angelo was twenty-two years younger) ought to have prevented all
unseemly jealousy; but Michael Angelo was haughty and impatient of all
superiority, or even equality; Leonardo, sensitive, capricious, and
naturally disinclined to admit the pretensions of a rival, to whom he
could say, and <i>did</i> say, "I was famous before you were born!" With all
their admiration of each other's genius, their mutual frailties
prevented any real good-will on either side.</p>

<p>Leonardo, during his stay at Florence, painted the portrait of Ginevra
Benci, the reigning beauty of her time. We find that in 1502 he was
engaged by Cæsar Borgia to visit and report on the fortifications of his
territories, and in this office he was employed for two years. In 1503
he formed a plan for turning the course of the Arno, and in the
following year he lost his father. In 1505 he modelled the group which
we now see over the northern door of the San Giovanni, at Florence. In
1514 he was invited to Rome by Leo X., but more in his character of
philosopher, mechanic, and alchemist, than as a painter. Here Raphael
was at the height of his fame, and engaged in his greatest works, the
frescos of the Vatican. The younger artist was introduced to the elder;
and two pictures which Leonardo painted while at Rome&mdash;the "Madonna of
St. Onofrio," and the "Holy Family," painted for Filiberta of Savoy, the
pope's sister-in-law (which is now at St. Petersburg)&mdash;show that even
this veteran in art felt the irresistible influence of the genius of his
young rival. They are both <i>Raffaelesque</i> in the subject and treatment.</p>

<p>It appears that Leonardo was ill-satisfied with his sojourn at Rome. He
had long been accustomed to hold the first rank as an artist wherever he
resided; whereas at Rome he found himself only one among many who, if
they acknowledged his greatness, affected to consider his day as past.
He was conscious that many of the improvements in the arts which were
now brought into use, and which enabled the painters of the day to
produce such extraordinary effects, were invented or introduced by
himself. If he could no longer assert that measureless superiority over
all others which he had done in his younger days, it was because he
himself had opened to them new paths to excellence. The arrival of his
old competitor, Michael Angelo, and some slight on the part of Leo X.,
who was annoyed by his speculative and dilatory habits in executing the
works intrusted to him, all added to his irritation and disgust. He left
Rome, and set out for Pavia, where the French king, Francis I., then
held his court. He was received by the young monarch with every mark of
respect, loaded with favors, and a pension of 700 gold crowns settled on
him for life. At the famous conference between Francis I. and Leo X.,
at Bologna, Leonardo attended his new patron, and was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214"></a>(p. 214)</span> of
essential service to him on that occasion. In the following year, 1516,
he returned with Francis I. to France, and was attached to the French
court as principal painter. It appears, however, that during his
residence in France he did not paint a single picture. His health had
begun to decline from the time he left Italy; and feeling his end
approach, he prepared himself for it by religious meditation, by acts of
charity, and by a most conscientious distribution by will of all his
worldly possessions to his relatives and friends. At length, after
protracted suffering, this great and most extraordinary man died at
Cloux, near Amboise, May 2, 1519, being then in his sixty-seventh year.
It is to be regretted that we cannot wholly credit the beautiful story
of his dying in the arms of Francis I., who, as it is said, had come to
visit him on his death-bed. It would indeed have been, as Fuseli
expressed it, "an honor to the king, by which destiny would have atoned
to that monarch for his future disaster at Pavia."<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>


<h3>MICHAEL ANGELO<br>

</div>

<p>We have spoken of Leonardo da Vinci. Michael Angelo, the other great
luminary of art, was twenty-two years younger, but the more severe and
reflective cast of his mind rendered their difference of age far less in
effect than in reality. It is usual to compare Michael Angelo with
Raphael, but he is more aptly compared with Leonardo da Vinci. All the
great artists of that time, even Raphael himself, were influenced more
or less by these two extraordinary men, but they exercised no influence
on each other. They started from opposite points; they pursued
throughout their whole existence, and in all they planned and achieved,
a course as different as their respective characters.</p>

<p>Michael Angelo Buonarroti was born at Setignano, near Florence, in the
year 1474. He was descended from a family once noble&mdash;even among the
noblest of the feudal lords of Northern Italy&mdash;the Counts of Canossa;
but that branch of it represented by his father, Luigi Leonardo
Buonarroti Simoni, had for some generations become poorer and poorer,
until the last descendant was thankful to accept an office in the law,
and had been nominated magistrate or mayor (<i>Podesta</i>) of Chiusi. In
this situation he had limited his ambition to the prospect of seeing
his eldest son a notary or advocate <span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215"></a>(p. 215)</span> in his native city. The
young Michael Angelo showed the utmost distaste for the studies allotted
to him, and was continually escaping from his home and from his desk to
haunt the ateliers of the painters, particularly that of Ghirlandajo who
was then at the height of his reputation.</p>

<p>The father of Michael Angelo, who found his family increase too rapidly
for his means, had destined some of his sons for commerce (it will be
recollected that in Genoa and Florence the most powerful nobles were
merchants or manufacturers), and others for civil or diplomatic
employments; but the fine arts, as being at that time productive of
little honor or emolument, he held in no esteem, and treated these
tastes of his eldest son sometimes with contempt and sometimes even with
harshness. Michael Angelo, however, had formed some friendships among
the young painters, and particularly with Francesco Granacci, one of the
best pupils of Ghirlandajo; he contrived to borrow models and drawings,
and studied them in secret with such persevering assiduity and
consequent improvement, that Ghirlandajo, captivated by his genius,
undertook to plead his cause to his father, and at length prevailed over
the old man's family pride and prejudices. At the age of fourteen
Michael Angelo was received into the studio of Ghirlandajo as a regular
pupil, and bound to him for three years; and such was the precocious
talent of the boy, that, instead of being paid for his instruction,
Ghirlandajo undertook to pay the father, Leonardo Buonarroti, for the
first, second, and third years, six, eight, and twelve golden florins,
as payment for the advantage he expected to derive from the labor of the
son. Thus was the vocation of the young artist decided for life.</p>

<p>At that time Lorenzo the Magnificent reigned over Florence. He had
formed in his palace and gardens a collection of antique marbles, busts,
statues, fragments, which he had converted into an academy for the use
of young artists, placing at the head of it as director a sculptor of
some eminence, named Bertoldo. Michael Angelo was one of the first who,
through the recommendation of Ghirlandajo, was received into this new
academy, afterward so famous and so memorable in the history of art. The
young man, then not quite sixteen, had hitherto occupied himself chiefly
in drawing; but now, fired by the beauties he beheld around him, and by
the example and success of a fellow-pupil, Torregiano, he set himself to
model in clay, and at length to copy in marble what was before him; but,
as was natural in a character and genius so steeped in individuality,
his copies became not so much imitations of form as original embodyings
of the leading idea. For example: his first attempt in marble, when he
was about fifteen, was a copy of an antique mask of an old laughing
Faun; he treated this in a manner so different from the original, and so
spirited as to excite the astonishment of Lorenzo de Medici, who
criticised it, however, saying, "Thou shouldst have remembered that old
folks do not retain all their teeth; some of them are always wanting."
The boy struck the teeth out, giving it at once the most grotesque
expression; and Lorenzo, infinitely amused, sent for his father and
offered to attach his son to his own particular service, and to
undertake the entire care of his education. The father consented, on
condition of receiving for himself an office <span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216"></a>(p. 216)</span> under the
government, and thenceforth Michael Angelo was lodged in the palace of
the Medici and treated by Lorenzo as his son.</p>

<p>Michael Angelo continued his studies under the auspices of Lorenzo; but
just as he had reached his eighteenth year he lost his generous patron,
his second father, and was thenceforth thrown on his own resources. It
is true that the son of Lorenzo, Piero de Medici, continued to extend
his favor to the young artist, but with so little comprehension of his
genius and character, that on one occasion, during the severe winter of
1494, he set him to form a statue of snow for the amusement of his
guests.</p>

<p>Michael Angelo, while he yielded, perforce, to the caprices of his
protector, turned the energies of his mind to a new study&mdash;that of
anatomy&mdash;and pursued it with all that fervor which belonged to his
character. His attention was at the same time directed to literature, by
the counsels and conversations of a very celebrated scholar and poet
then residing in the court of Piero&mdash;Angelo Poliziano; and he pursued at
the same time the cultivation of his mind and the practice of his art.
Engrossed by his own studies, he was scarcely aware of what was passing
around him, nor of the popular intrigues which were preparing the ruin
of the Medici; suddenly this powerful family were flung from sovereignty
to temporary disgrace and exile; and Michael Angelo, as one of their
retainers, was obliged to fly from Florence, and took refuge in the city
of Bologna. During the year he spent there he found a friend, who
employed him on some works of sculpture; and on his return to Florence
he executed a Cupid in marble, of such beauty that it found its way into
the cabinet of the Duchess of Mantua as a real antique. On the discovery
that the author of this beautiful statue was a young man of
two-and-twenty, the Cardinal San Giorgio invited him to Rome, and for
some time lodged him in his palace. Here Michael Angelo, surrounded and
inspired by the grand remains of antiquity, pursued his studies with
unceasing energy; he produced a statue of Bacchus, which added to his
reputation; and in 1500, at the age of five-and-twenty, he produced the
famous group of the dead Christ on the knees of his Virgin Mother
(called the "Pietà"), which is now in the church of St. Peter's, at
Rome; this last being frequently copied and imitated, obtained him so
much applause and reputation, that he was recalled to Florence, to
undertake several public works, and we find him once more established in
his native city in the year 1502.</p>

<p>In 1506 Michael Angelo was summoned to Rome by Pope Julius II., who,
while living, had conceived the idea of erecting a most splendid
monument to perpetuate his memory. For this work, which was never
completed, Michael Angelo executed the famous statue of Moses, seated,
grasping his flowing beard with one hand, and with the other sustaining
the tables of the Law. While employed on this tomb, the pope commanded
him to undertake also the decoration of the ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel. Pope Sixtus IV. had, in the year 1473, erected this famous
chapel, and summoned the best painters of that time, Signorelli, Cosimo
Roselli, Perugino, and Ghirlandajo, to decorate the interior; but down
to the year 1508 the ceiling remained without any ornament; and Michael
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page217" name="page217"></a>(p. 217)</span> Angelo was called upon to cover this enormous vault, a space of
one hundred and fifty feet in length by fifty in breadth, with a series
of subjects representing the most important events connected, either
literally or typically, with the fall and redemption of mankind.</p>

<p>No part of Michael Angelo's long life is so interesting, so full of
characteristic incident, as the history of his intercourse with Pope
Julius II., which began in 1505, and ended only with the death of the
pope in 1513.</p>

<p>Michael Angelo had at all times a lofty idea of his own dignity as an
artist, and never would stoop either to flatter a patron or to
conciliate a rival. Julius II., though now seventy-four, was as
impatient of contradiction as fiery in temper, as full of magnificent
and ambitious projects as if he had been in the prime of life; in his
service was the famous architect, Bramante, who beheld with jealousy and
alarm the increasing fame of Michael Angelo, and his influence with the
pontiff, and set himself by indirect means to lessen both. He insinuated
to Julius that it was ominous to erect his own mausoleum during his
lifetime, and the pope gradually fell off in his attentions to Michael
Angelo, and neglected to supply him with the necessary funds for
carrying on the work. On one occasion, Michael Angelo, finding it
difficult to obtain access to the pope, sent a message to him to this
effect, "that henceforth, if his Holiness desired to see him, he should
send to seek him elsewhere;" and the same night, leaving orders with his
servants to dispose of his property, he departed for Florence. The pope
despatched five couriers after him with threats, persuasions,
promises&mdash;but in vain. He wrote to the Gonfaloniere Soderini, then at
the head of the government of Florence, commanding him, on pain of his
extreme displeasure, to send Michael Angelo back to him; but the
inflexible artist absolutely refused; three months were spent in vain
negotiations. Soderini, at length, fearing the pope's anger, prevailed
on Michael Angelo to return, and sent with him his relation, Cardinal
Soderini, to make up the quarrel between the high contending powers.</p>

<p>On his return to Rome, Michael Angelo wished to have resumed his work on
the mausoleum; but the pope had resolved on the completion of the
Sistine Chapel; he commanded Michael Angelo to undertake the decoration
of the vaulted ceiling; and the artist was obliged, though reluctantly,
to obey. At this time the frescos which Raphael and his pupils were
painting in the chambers of the Vatican had excited the admiration of
all Rome. Michael Angelo, who had never exercised himself in the
mechanical part of the art of fresco, invited from Florence several
painters of eminence, to execute his designs under his own
superintendence; but they could not reach the grandeur of his
conceptions, which became enfeebled under their hands, and one morning,
in a mood of impatience, he destroyed all that they had done, closed the
doors of the chapel against them, and would not thenceforth admit them
to his presence. He then shut himself up, and proceeded with incredible
perseverance and energy to accomplish his task alone; he even prepared
his colors with his own hands. He began with the end toward the door,
and in the two compartments first painted (though not first in the
series), the "Deluge," and the "Vineyard of Noah;" he <span class="pagenum"><a id="page218" name="page218"></a>(p. 218)</span> made the
figures too numerous and too small to produce their full effect from
below, a fault which he corrected in those executed subsequently. When
almost half the work was completed, the pope insisted on viewing what
was done, and the astonishment and admiration it excited rendered him
more and more eager to have the whole completed at once. The progress,
however, was not rapid enough to suit the impatient temper of the
pontiff. On one occasion he demanded of the artist <i>when</i> he meant to
finish it; to which Michael Angelo replied calmly, "When I can." "When
thou canst!" exclaimed the fiery old pope, "thou hast a mind that I
should have thee thrown from the scaffold!" At length, on the day of All
Saints, 1512, the ceiling was uncovered to public view. Michael Angelo
had employed on the painting only, without reckoning the time spent in
preparing the cartoons, twenty-two months, and he received in payment
three thousand crowns.</p>

<p>The collection of engravings after Michael Angelo in the British Museum
is very imperfect, but it contains some fine old prints from the
Prophets which should be studied by those who wish to understand the
true merit of this great master, of whom Sir Joshua Reynolds said that,
"to kiss the hem of his garment, to catch the slightest of his
perfections, would be glory and distinction enough for an ambitious
man!"</p>

<p>When the Sistine Chapel was completed Michael Angelo was in his
thirty-ninth year; fifty years of a glorious though troubled career were
still before him.</p>

<p>Pope Julius II. died in 1513, and was succeeded by Leo X., the son of
Lorenzo the Magnificent. As a Florentine and his father's son, we might
naturally have expected that he would have gloried in patronizing and
employing Michael Angelo; but such was not the case. There was something
in the stern, unbending character, and retired and abstemious habits of
Michael Angelo, repulsive to the temper of Leo, who preferred the
graceful and amiable Raphael, then in the prime of his life and genius;
hence arose the memorable rivalry between Michael Angelo and Raphael,
which on the part of the latter was merely generous emulation, while it
must be confessed that something like scorn mingled with the feelings of
Michael Angelo. The pontificate of Leo X., an interval of ten years, was
the least productive period of his life. In the year 1519, when the
Signoria of Florence was negotiating with Ravenna for the restoration of
the remains of Dante, he petitioned the pope that he might be allowed to
execute, at his own labor and expense, a monument to the "Divine Poet."
He was sent to Florence to superintend the building of the church of San
Lorenzo and the completion of Santa Croce; but he differed with the pope
on the choice of the marble, quarrelled with the officials, and scarcely
anything was accomplished. Clement VII., another Medici, was elected
pope in 1523. He had conceived the idea of consecrating a chapel in the
church of San Lorenzo, to receive the tombs of his ancestors and
relations, and which should be adorned with all the splendor of art.
Michael Angelo planned and built the chapel, and for its interior
decoration designed and executed six of his greatest works in sculpture.</p>

<p>While Michael Angelo was engaged in these works his progress was
interrupted <span class="pagenum"><a id="page219" name="page219"></a>(p. 219)</span> by events which threw all Italy into commotion.
Rome was taken and sacked by the Constable de Bourbon in 1527. The
Medici were once more expelled from Florence; and Michael Angelo, in the
midst of these strange vicissitudes, was employed by the republic to
fortify his native city against his former patrons. Great as an
engineer, as in every other department of art and science, he defended
Florence for nine months. At length the city was given up by treachery,
and, fearing the vengeance of the conquerors, Michael Angelo fled and
concealed himself; but Clement VII. was too sensible of his merit to
allow him to remain long in disgrace and exile. He was pardoned, and
continued ever afterward in high favor with the pope, who employed him
on the sculptures in the chapel of San Lorenzo during the remainder of
his pontificate.</p>

<p>In the year 1531 he had completed the statues of "Night and Morning,"
and Clement, who heard of his incessant labors, sent him a brief
commanding him, <i>on pain of excommunication</i>, to take care of his
health, and not to accept of any other work but that which his Holiness
had assigned him.</p>

<p>Clement VII. was succeeded by Pope Paul III., of the Farnese family, in
1534. This pope, though nearly seventy when he was elected, was as
anxious to immortalize his name by great undertakings as any of his
predecessors had been. His first wish was to complete the decoration of
the interior of the Sistine Chapel, left unfinished by Julius II. and
Leo X. He summoned Michael Angelo, who endeavored to excuse himself,
pleading other engagements; but the pope would listen to no excuses
which interfered with his sovereign power to dissolve all other
obligations; and thus the artist found himself, after an interval of
twenty years, most reluctantly forced to abandon sculpture for painting;
and, as Vasari expresses it, he consented to serve Pope Paul only
because he <i>could</i> not do otherwise.</p>

<p>The same Pope Paul III. had in the meantime constructed a beautiful
chapel, which was called after his name the chapel <i>Paolina</i>, and
dedicated to St. Peter and St Paul. Michael Angelo was called upon to
design the decorations. He painted on one side the "Conversion of St.
Paul," and on the other the "Crucifixion of St. Peter," which were
completed in 1549. But these fine paintings&mdash;of which existing old
engravings give a better idea than the blackened and faded remains of
the original frescos&mdash;were from the first ill-disposed as to the
locality, and badly lighted, and at present they excite little interest
compared with the more famous works in the Sistine.</p>

<p>With the frescos in the Pauline Chapel ends Michael Angelo's career as a
painter. He had been appointed chief architect of St. Peter's, in 1547,
by Paul III. He was then in his seventy-second year, and during the
remainder of his life, a period of sixteen years, we find him wholly
devoted to architecture. His vast and daring genius finding ample scope
in the completion of St. Peter's, he has left behind him in his capacity
of architect yet greater marvels than he has achieved as painter and
sculptor. Who that has seen the cupola of St. Peter's soaring into the
skies, but will think almost with awe of the universal and majestic
intellect of the man who reared it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page220" name="page220"></a>(p. 220)</span> It appears, from the evidence of contemporary writers, that in
the last years of his life the acknowledged worth and genius of Michael
Angelo, his widespread fame, and his unblemished integrity, combined
with his venerable age and the haughtiness and reserve of his deportment
to invest him with a sort of princely dignity. It is recorded that, when
he waited on Pope Julius III., to receive his commands, the pontiff rose
on his approach, seated him, in spite of his excuses, on his right hand,
and while a crowd of cardinals, prelates, and ambassadors, were standing
round at humble distance, carried on the conference as equal with equal.
When the Grand Duke Cosmo was in Rome, in 1560, he visited Michael
Angelo, uncovered in his presence, and stood with his hat in his hand
while speaking to him; but from the time when he made himself the tyrant
of Florence he never could persuade Michael Angelo to visit, even for a
day, his native city.</p>

<p>The arrogance imputed to Michael Angelo seems rather to have arisen from
a contempt for others than from any overweening opinion of himself. He
was too proud to be vain. He had placed his standard of perfection so
high, that to the latest hour of his life he considered himself as
striving after that ideal excellence which had been revealed to him, but
to which he conceived that others were blind or indifferent. In allusion
to his own imperfections, he made a drawing, since become famous, which
represents an aged man in a go-cart, and underneath the words "<i>Ancora
impara</i>" (still learning).</p>

<p>He continued to labor unremittingly, and with the same resolute energy
of mind and purpose, till the gradual decay of his strength warned him
of his approaching end. He did not suffer from any particular malady,
and his mind was strong and clear to the last. He died at Rome, on
February 18, 1564, in the ninetieth year of his age. A few days before
his death he dictated his will in these few simple words: "I bequeath my
soul to God, my body to the earth, and my possessions to my nearest
relations." His nephew, Leonardo Buonarroti, who was his principal heir,
by the orders of the Grand Duke Cosmo had his remains secretly conveyed
out of Rome and brought to Florence; they were with due honors deposited
in the church of Santa Croce, under a costly monument, on which we may
see his noble bust surrounded by three very commonplace and ill-executed
statues, representing the arts in which he excelled&mdash;Painting,
Sculpture, and Architecture. They might have added <i>Poetry</i>, for Michael
Angelo was so fine a poet that his productions would have given him
fame, though he had never peopled the Sistine with his giant creations,
nor "suspended the Pantheon in the air." The object to whom his poems
are chiefly addressed, Vittoria Colonna, Marchioness of Pescara, was the
widow of the celebrated commander who overcame Francis I. at the battle
of Pavia; herself a poetess, and one of the most celebrated women of her
time for beauty, talents, virtue, and piety. She died in 1547.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<p>The solemn and silent season of Lent had passed away; and, on the second
evening of the joyful Easter, a house was seen brightly illuminated in
one of the streets of Urbino. It was evident that a festival was held
there on some happy occasion. The sound of music was heard, and guest
after guest entered the mansion. No one, however, was more cordially
welcomed than Pietro Perugino, the fellow-student of Leonardo da Vinci,
at the school of the good old Andrea Verocchio.</p>

<p>For a moment, general gayety was suspended in honor of the guest. He was
considered at that time one of the greatest painters of the age; and the
host, Giovanni di Sanzio, though himself only ranking in the second or
third order of limners, knew well how to prize the rare talents of his
visitor.</p>

<p>The wife of Giovanni came forward, leading her son Raphael. Perugino had
the eye of an artist: he gazed upon the mother and son with enthusiastic
feeling; the striking resemblance they bore to each other, so
exquisitely modulated by years and sex, was indeed a study for this
minute copyist of nature.</p>

<p>"Benvenuto, Messer Perugino," said the hostess, with her soft musical
voice and graceful Italian accent, and she placed the hand of her boy in
that of the artist. Gently he laid the other on the head of the youthful
Raphael, and in a solemn and tender manner pronounced a benediction.</p>

<p>"Your blessing is well timed, my honored friend," said Giovanni, "our
festival is given to celebrate the birthday of our son."</p>

<p>"Is this his birthday?" inquired Perugino.</p>

<p>"Not so," replied the father, "he was born on April 7th, the evening of
<i>Good Friday</i>, and it well befits us to be gay on the joyful Easter that
succeeds it."</p>

<p>"My friend," said Perugino, "if thou wilt entrust thy boy to my care, I
will take him as my pupil."</p>

<p>The father acceded with delight to this proposal. When the mother became
acquainted with the arrangement, and found that her son was to quit his
paternal dwelling at the early age of twelve, and reside wholly with
Perugino, she could not restrain her tears. With hers the young
Raphael's mingled, though ever and anon a bright smile darted like a
sunbeam across his face.</p>

<p>He remained with Perugino several years. Raphael was made for affection,
and fondly did his heart cling to his instructor. For a time he was
content to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page222" name="page222"></a>(p. 222)</span> follow his manner; but at length he began to dwell
upon his own beau ideal; he grew impatient of imitation, and felt that
his style was deficient in freshness and originality. He longed to pass
the narrow bounds to which his invention had been confined.</p>

<p>With the approbation of Perugino and the consent of his parents, he
repaired to Siena; here he was solicited to adorn the public library
with fresco, and painted there with great success. But while he was
busily engaged, his friend, Pinturrichio, one day entered. After looking
at his friend's work very attentively, "Bravo!" he exclaimed, "thou hast
done well, my Raphael&mdash;but I have just returned from Florence&mdash;oh, would
that thou couldst behold the works of Leonardo da Vinci! Such horses!
they paw the ground and shake the foam from their manes. Oh, my poor
Raphael! thou hast never seen nature; thou art wasting time on these
cartoons. Perugino is a good man and a good painter, I will not deny
that&mdash;but Leonardo's horses!"</p>

<p>Raphael threw aside his pencil and hastily rose.</p>

<p>"Where now?" asked his friend; "whither art thou going so hastily?"</p>

<p>"To Florence," exclaimed Raphael.</p>

<p>"And what carries you so suddenly?"</p>

<p>"The horses of Leonardo," replied the young artist, sportively;
"seriously, however, the desire of excellence implanted in my soul."</p>

<p>When he arrived at Florence he was charmed with the appearance of the
city; but his whole mind was absorbed in the works of Leonardo da Vinci
and of Michael Angelo, the rival artists of the age. As his stay was to
be short, he did not enter upon laborious occupation. His mornings were
passed in the reveries of his art; his evenings in the gay and
fascinating society of Florence, where the fame of Perugino's beloved
pupil had already reached. The frescos at Siena were spoken of; and the
beautiful countenance and graceful deportment of Raphael won him the
friendship of distinguished men. Taddeo Taddei, the learned friend of
Cardinal Bembo, solicited him to reside in his house; he consented, and
in return for the courtesy painted for him two pictures, in what is
called his first style, that of Perugino.</p>

<p>One evening he retired to his couch at a late hour. He had been the hero
of a <i>fête</i>, and love and beauty had heedlessly scattered their flowers
in the path of the living Adonis. In vain he sought a few hours of
slumber. He had quaffed the juice of the grape, emptying goblet after
goblet, till his beating pulse and throbbing temples refused to be
quieted. He started from his couch and approached the lattice; the
heavens had changed their aspect, the still serenity of the evening had
passed away, and the clouds were hurrying over the pale and watery moon.
Nothing was heard but the low sighing of the wind, and now and then a
sudden gust swept through the lattice, and threatened to extinguish the
taper which was burning dimly on the table. A slight noise made him turn
his eyes, and he perceived a note that the wind had displaced. He
hastily took it up. It was Perugino's handwriting. He cut the silken
cord that fastened it, and read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page223" name="page223"></a>(p. 223)</span> "On me, my beloved Raffaello, devolves the task of informing
you of the events which have taken place at Urbino. May this letter find
you prepared for all the changes of life; a wise man will never suffer
himself to be taken by surprise; this is true philosophy, and the <i>only
philosophy</i> that can serve us! An epidemic has prevailed at Urbino, and
has entered your paternal dwelling. Need I say more? Come to me, my son,
at Perugia, for I am the only parent that remains to you. Pietro
Perugino."</p>

<p>As he hastily arose, a crucifix which his mother had suspended to his
neck at parting, fell from his bosom. Even the symbols of religion are
sacred where the living principle has been early implanted in the heart.
He pressed it to his lips: "Ah!" thought he, "what is the <i>philosophy</i>
of Perugino, compared to the <i>faith</i> of which this is the emblem?" His
thoughts went back to infancy and childhood, and his grief and remorse
grew less intense. He dwelt on the deep and enduring love of his parents
till he felt assured death could not extinguish it, and that he should
see them again in a brighter sphere.</p>

<p>When morning came it found Raphael calm and composed; the lines of grief
and thought were deeply marked on his youthful face; but the whirlwind
and the storm had passed. He took leave of his friends, and hastened to
Perugino, who received him with the fondness of a parent.</p>

<p>Here he remained some time, and at length collected sufficient
resolution to return to Urbino, and once more enter the mansion of his
desolated home.</p>

<p>It was necessary for him to reside at his native place for a number of
months. During that time he painted several fine pictures. His heart,
however, yearned for Florence, and he returned to it once more with the
determination of making it his home. With far different sensations did
he a second time enter the city of beauty. The freshness of his gayety
was blighted; lessons of earthly disappointment were ever present to his
mind, and he returned to it with the resolute purpose of devoting
himself to serious occupation.</p>

<p>How well he fulfilled this resolution all Italy can bear witness. From
this time he adopted what has been called his <i>second manner</i>. He
painted for the Duke of Urbino the beautiful picture of the Saviour at
sunrise, with the morning light cast over a face resplendent with
divinity; the flowers glittering with dew, the two disciples beyond,
still buried in slumber, at the time when the Saviour turns his eyes
upon them with that tender and sorrowful exclamation, "Could ye not
watch one hour?"</p>

<p>Raphael enriched the city of Florence with his works. When asked what
had suggested some of the beautiful combinations of his paintings, he
said, "They came to me in my sleep." At other times he called them
"visions;" and then again said they were the result of "una certa idea
che mi viene alla mente." It was this power of drawing from the deep
wells of his own mind that gave such character, originality, and
freshness to his works. He found that power <i>within</i> which so many seek,
and seek in vain, <i>without</i>.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-five Raphael was summoned by the pope to paint the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page224" name="page224"></a>(p. 224)</span> chambers of the Vatican. The famous frescos of the Vatican need
neither enumeration nor description; the world is their judge and their
eulogist.</p>

<p>No artist ever consecrated his works more by his affections than
Raphael. The same hallowed influence of the heart gave inexpressible
charm to Correggio's, afterward. One of Raphael's friends said to him,
in looking upon particular figures in his groups, "You have transmitted
to posterity your own likeness."</p>

<p>"See you nothing beyond that?" replied the artist.</p>

<p>"I see," said the critic, "the deep-blue eye, and the long, fair hair
parted on the forehead."</p>

<p>"Observe," said Raphael, "the feminine softness of expression, the
beautiful harmony of thought and feeling. When I take my pencil for high
and noble purposes, the spirit of my mother hovers over me. It is her
countenance, not my own, of which you trace the resemblance."</p>

<p>This expression is always observable in his Madonnas. His portraits of
the <i>Fornarina</i> are widely different. Raphael, in his last and most
excellent style, united what was graceful and exquisite in Leonardo with
the sublime and noble manner of Michael Angelo. It is the privilege and
glory of genius to appropriate to itself whatever is noble and true. The
region of thought is thus made a common ground for all, and one master
mind becomes a reservoir for the present and future times.</p>

<p>When Raphael was invited to Rome by Pope Julius II., Michael Angelo was
at the height of his glory; his character tended to inspire awe rather
than affection; he delighted in the majestic and the terrible. In
boldness of conception and grandeur of design, he surpassed Leonardo,
but never could reach the sweetness and gentleness of his figures. Even
his children lose something of their infantine beauty, and look mature;
his women are commanding and lofty; his men of gigantic proportions. His
painting, like his sculpture, is remarkable for anatomical exactness,
and perfect expression of the muscles. For this union of magnificence
and sublimity, it was necessary to prepare the mind; the first view was
almost harsh, and it was by degrees that his mighty works produced their
designed effect. Raphael, while he felt all the greatness of the
Florentine, conceived that there might be something more like
nature&mdash;something that should be harmonious, sweet, and flowing&mdash;that
should convey the idea of intellectual rather than of external majesty.
Without yielding any of the correctness of science, he avoided
harshness, and imitated antiquity in uniting grace and elegance with a
strict observation of science and of the rules of art.</p>

<p>It was with surprise that Michael Angelo beheld in the youthful Raphael
a rival artist; nor did he receive this truth meekly; he treated him
with coldness and distance. In the meantime Raphael went on with his
works; he completed the frescos of the Vatican, and designed the
cartoons. He also produced those exquisite paintings in oil which seem
the perfection of human art.</p>

<a id="img007" name="img007"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img007.jpg" width="600" height="387" alt="" title="">
<p>Leo X. at Raphael's Bier.</p>
</div>

<p>Human affection is necessary to awaken the sympathy of human beings; and
Raphael, in learning how to portray it, had found the way to the heart.
In mere grandeur of invention he was surpassed by Michael Angelo.
Titian excelled him <span class="pagenum"><a id="page225" name="page225"></a>(p. 225)</span> in coloring, and Correggio in the
beautiful gradation of tone; but Raphael knew how to paint the soul; in
this he stood alone. This was the great secret of a power which seemed
to operate like magic. In his paintings there is something which makes
music on the chords of every heart; for they are the expression of a
mind attuned to nature, and find answering sympathies in the universal
soul.</p>

<p>While Michael Angelo was exalted with the Epic grandeur of his own
Dante, Raphael presented the most finished scenes of dramatic life, and
might be compared to the immortal Shakespeare&mdash;scenes of spiritual
beauty, of devotion, and of pastoral simplicity, yet uniting a classic
elegance which the poet does not possess. Buonarroti was the wonder of
Italy, and Raphael became its idol.</p>

<p>Julius was so much enchanted with his paintings in the halls of the
Vatican, that he ordered the frescos of former artists to be destroyed.
Among them were some of Perugino's, but Raphael would not suffer these
to be removed for his own; he viewed them as the relics of a beloved and
honored friend, and they were consecrated by tender and grateful
feelings.</p>

<p>Raphael collected from every part of the world medallions of intaglios
and antiques to assist him in his designs. He loved splendor and
conviviality, and gave offence thereby to the rigid and austere. It was
said that he had a prospect of changing the graceful beretta for a
cardinal's hat; but this idea might have arisen from the delay which
existed in his marriage with Cardinal Bibiano's niece, whose hand her
uncle had offered to him. Peremptorily to reject this proposal of the
cardinal without giving offence would have been impossible, and Raphael
was too gentle in his own feelings voluntarily to injure another's; but
he was not one to sacrifice his affections to ambition.</p>

<p>Whatever were the struggles of his heart, they were early terminated.
Amid the caresses of the great, the fond and devoted friendship of his
equals, the enthusiastic love of his pupils, the adulation of his
inferiors, while crowned with wealth, fame, and honor, and regarded as
the equal of the hitherto greatest artist in the world, he was suddenly
called away. He died on Good Friday, the day of his birth, at the age of
thirty-seven, 1520.</p>

<p>We are sometimes impressed with veneration when those who have even
drunk the cup of life almost to its dregs resign it with resignation and
Christian faith. But Raphael calmly and firmly resigned it when it was
full to the brim.</p>

<p>Leo X. and Cardinal Bibiano were by his bedside. The sublime picture of
the "Transfiguration," the last and greatest which he painted, was
placed opposite to him, by his own desire. How impressive must have been
the scene! His dying eye turned from the crucifix he held in his hand to
the glory of the beatified Saviour.</p>

<p>His contemporaries speak of him as affectionate, disinterested, modest,
and sincere; encouraging humble merit, and freely giving his advice and
assistance where it was needed and deserved.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

</div>

<p>Titian was born in the year 1480, at Cadore, a small place distant about
five miles from the foot of the Alps; he belonged to the family of the
Vecelli, which is among the most noble of those parts. Giving early
proof of much intelligence, he was sent at the age of ten to an uncle in
Venice, an honorable citizen, who, seeing the boy to be much inclined to
painting, placed him with the excellent painter, Gian Bellino, then very
famous. Under his care, the youth soon proved himself to be endowed by
nature with all the gifts of judgment and genius required for the art of
painting. Now, Gian Bellino and the other masters of that country, not
having the habit of studying the antique, were accustomed to copy only
what they saw before them, and that in a dry, hard, labored manner,
which Titian also acquired; but about the year 1507, Giorgione da Castel
Franco, not being satisfied with that mode of proceeding, began to give
to his works an unwonted softness and relief, painting them in a very
beautiful manner; yet he by no means neglected to draw from the life, or
to copy nature with his colors as closely as he could; and in doing the
latter he shaded with colder or warmer tints as the living object might
demand, but without first making a drawing; since he held that, to paint
with the colors only, without any drawing on paper, was the best mode of
proceeding, and most perfectly in accord with the true principles of
design.</p>

<p>Having seen the manner of Giorgione, Titian early resolved to abandon
that of Gian Bellino, although well grounded therein. He now, therefore,
devoted himself to this purpose, and in a short time so closely imitated
Giorgione that his pictures were sometimes taken for those of that
master, as will be related below. Increasing in age, judgment, and
facility of hand, our young artist executed numerous works in fresco
which cannot here be named individually, having been dispersed in
various places; let it suffice to say, that they were such as to cause
experienced <span class="pagenum"><a id="page227" name="page227"></a>(p. 227)</span> men to anticipate the excellence to which he
afterward attained. At the time when Titian began to adopt the manner of
Giorgione, being then not more than eighteen, he took the portrait of a
gentleman of the Barberigo family, who was his friend, and this was
considered very beautiful, the coloring being true and natural, and the
hair so distinctly painted that each one could be counted as might also
the stitches in a satin doublet, painted in the same work; it was so
well and carefully done, that it would have been taken for a picture by
Giorgione, if Titian had not written his name on the dark ground.</p>

<p>Giorgione meanwhile had executed the façade of the German Exchange,
when, by the intervention of Barberigo, Titian was appointed to paint
certain stories in the same building and over the Merceria. After which
he executed a picture with figures the size of life, which is now in the
Hall of Messer Andrea Loredano, who dwells near San Marcuola; this work
represents "Our Lady" in her flight into Egypt. She is in the midst of a
great wood, and the landscape of this picture is well done; Titian
having practised that branch of art, and keeping certain Germans, who
were excellent masters therein, for several months together in his own
house. Within the wood he depicted various animals, all painted from the
life, and so natural as to seem almost alive. In the house of Messer
Giovanni Danna, a Flemish gentleman and merchant, who was his gossip, he
painted a portrait which appears to breathe, with an "Ecce Homo,"
comprising numerous figures which, by Titian himself, as well as others,
is considered to be a very good work. The same artist executed a picture
of "Our Lady," with other figures the size of life, men and children
being all taken from nature, and portraits of persons belonging to the
Danna family.</p>

<p>In the year 1507, when the Emperor Maximilian was making war on the
Venetians, Titian, as he relates himself, painted the "Angel Raphael,
with Tobit and a Dog," in the Church of San Marziliano. There is a
distant landscape in this picture, wherein San Giovanni Battista is seen
at prayer in a wood; he is looking up to heaven, and his face is
illumined by a light descending thence; some believe this picture to
have been done before that on the "Exchange of the Germans," mentioned
above, was commenced. Now, it chanced that certain gentlemen, not
knowing that Giorgione no longer worked at this façade, and that Titian
was doing it (nay, had already given that part over the Merceria to
public view), met the former, and began as friends to rejoice with him,
declaring that he was acquitting himself better on the side of the
Merceria than he had done on that of the "Grand Canal;" which remark
caused Giorgione so much vexation, that he would scarcely permit himself
to be seen until the whole work was completed, and Titian had become
generally known as the painter; nor did he thenceforward hold any
intercourse with the latter and they were no longer friends.</p>

<p>In the year 1508, Titian published a wood-engraving of the "Triumph of
Faith;" it comprised a vast number of figures: our first Parents, the
Patriarchs, the Prophets, the Sybils, the Innocents, the Martyrs, the
Apostles, and Our Saviour Christ borne in triumph by the four
Evangelists, and the four Doctors, followed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page228" name="page228"></a>(p. 228)</span> by the holy
Confessors; here Titian displayed much boldness, a fine manner, and
improving facility. I remember that Fra Bastiano del Piombo, speaking on
this subject, told me that if Titian had then gone to Rome, and seen the
works of Michael Angelo, with those of Raphael and the ancients, he was
convinced, the admirable facility of his coloring considered, that he
would have produced works of the most astonishing perfection; seeing
that, as he well deserved to be called the most perfect imitator of
Nature of our times, as regards coloring, he might thus have rendered
himself equal to the Urbinese or Buonarroto, as regarded the great
foundation of all, design. At a later period Titian repaired to Vicenza,
where he painted "The Judgment of Solomon," on the Loggetta wherein the
courts of justice are held; a very beautiful work. Returning to Venice,
he then depicted the façade of the Germain; at Padua he painted certain
frescos in the Church of Sant' Antonio, the subjects taken from the life
of that saint; and in the Church of Santo Spirito he executed a small
picture of San Marco seated in the midst of other saints, whose faces
are portraits painted in oil with the utmost care; this picture has been
taken for a work of Giorgione.</p>

<p>Now, the death of Giovan Bellino had caused a story in the hall of the
Great Council to remain unfinished; it was that which represents
Federigo Barbarossa kneeling before Pope Alessandro III., who plants his
foot on the emperor's neck. This was now finished by Titian, who altered
many parts of it, introducing portraits of his friends and others. For
this he received from the senate an office in the Exchange of the
Germans called the Senseria, which brought him in three hundred crowns
yearly, and which those Signori usually give to the most eminent painter
of their city, on condition that from time to time he shall take the
portrait of their doge, or prince when such shall be created, at the
price of eight crowns, which the doge himself pays, the portrait being
then preserved in the Palace of San Marco, as a memorial of that doge.</p>

<p>After the completion of these works, our artist painted, for the Church
of San Rocco, a figure of Christ bearing his cross; the Saviour has a
rope round his neck, and is dragged forward by a Jew; many have thought
this a work of Giorgione. It has become an object of the utmost devotion
in Venice, and has received more crowns as offerings than have been
earned by Titian and Giorgione both, through the whole course of their
lives. Now, Titian had taken the portrait of Bembo, then secretary to
Pope Leo X., and was by him invited to Rome, that he might see the city,
with Raffaello da Urbino and other distinguished persons; but the artist
having delayed his journey until 1520, when the pope and Raffaello were
both dead, put it off for that time altogether. For the Church of Santa
Maria Maggiore he painted a picture of "St. John the Baptist in the
wilderness;" there is an angel beside him that appears to be living; and
a distant landscape, with trees on the bank of a river, which are very
graceful. He took portraits of the Prince Grimani and Loredano, which
were considered admirable; and not long afterward he painted the
portrait of King Francis, who was then leaving Italy to return to
France.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img009.jpg" width="600" height="424" alt="" title="">
<p>A Fête at the House of Titian.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1530, when the Emperor Charles V. was in Bologna, Titian, by the
intervention <span class="pagenum"><a id="page229" name="page229"></a>(p. 229)</span> of Pietro Aretino, was invited to that city by
the Cardinal Ippolito de' Medici, and there he made a magnificent
portrait of his majesty in full armor. This gave so much satisfaction
that the artist received a present of a thousand crowns for the same.
Out of these he had subsequently to give the half to Alfonso Lombardi,
the sculptor, who had made a model of that monarch to be executed in
marble.</p>

<p>Having returned to Venice, Titian there found that many gentlemen had
begun to favor Pordenone, commending exceedingly the works executed by
that artist in the ceiling of the Hall of the Pregai, and elsewhere.
They had also procured him the commission for a small picture in the
Church of San Giovanni Elemosynario, which they intended him to paint in
competition with one representing that saint in his episcopal habits,
which had previously been executed there by Titian. But whatever care
and pains Pordenone took, he could not equal nor even approach the work
of the former. Titian was then appointed to paint a picture of the
Annunciation for the Church of Santa Maria degli Angeli, at Murano; but
those who gave the commission for the work, not wishing to pay so much
as five hundred crowns, which Titian required as its price, he sent it,
by the advice of Pietro Aretino, as a gift to Charles V., who being
greatly delighted with the work, made him a present of two thousand
crowns. The place which the picture was to have occupied at Murano was
then filled by one from the hand of Pordenone.</p>

<p>When the emperor, some time after this, returned with his army from
Hungary, and was again at Bologna, holding a conference with Clement
VII., he desired to have another portrait taken of him by Titian, who,
before he departed from the city, also painted that of the Cardinal
Ippolito de Medici in the Hungarian dress, with another of the same
prelate fully armed, which is somewhat smaller than the first; these are
both now in the Guardaroba of Duke Cosimo. He painted the portraits of
Alfonso, Marquis of Davalos, and of Pietro Aretino, at the same period,
and these things having made him known to Federigo Gonzaga, Duke of
Mantua, he entered the service of the latter, and accompanied him to his
states. At Mantua our artist made a portrait of the duke, which appears
to breathe, and afterward executed that of his brother, the cardinal.
These being finished, he painted twelve beautiful "Heads of the Twelve
Cæsars," to decorate one of the rooms erected by Giulio Romano, and when
they were done, Giulio painted a "Story from the Lives of the Emperors"
beneath each head.</p>

<p>The productions, but more especially the portraits, of Titian are so
numerous that it would be almost impossible to make the record of them
all. I will, therefore, speak of the principal only, and that without
order of time, seeing that it does not much signify to tell which was
painted earlier and which later. He took the portrait of Charles V.
several times, as we have said, and was finally invited by that monarch
to his court; there he painted him as he was in those last years; and so
much was that most invincible emperor pleased with the manner of Titian,
that once he had been portrayed by him, he would never permit himself
to be taken by any other person. Each time that Titian painted the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page230" name="page230"></a>(p. 230)</span> emperor he received a present of a thousand crowns of gold, and
the artist was made a cavalier, or knight, by his majesty, with a
revenue of two hundred crowns yearly, secured on the treasury of Naples,
and attached to his title.</p>

<p>When Titian painted Filippo, King of Spain, the son of Charles, he
received another annuity of two hundred crowns; so that these four
hundred, added to the three hundred from the German Exchange, make him a
fixed income of seven hundred crowns, which he possesses without the
necessity of exerting himself in any manner. Titian presented the
portraits of Charles V. and his son Filippo to the Duke Cosimo, who has
them now in his Guardaroba. He also took the portrait of Ferdinand, King
of the Romans, who was afterward emperor, with those of his children,
Maximilian, that is to say, now emperor, and his brother; he likewise
painted the Queen Maria; and at the command of the Emperor Charles, he
portrayed the Duke of Saxony, when the latter was in prison. But what a
waste of time is this! when there has scarcely been a noble of high
rank, scarcely a prince or lady of great name, whose portrait has not
been taken by Titian, who in that branch of art is indeed an excellent
painter.</p>

<p>All these works, with many others which I omit to avoid prolixity, have
been executed up to the present age of our artist, which is above
seventy-six years. Titian has been always healthy and happy; he has been
favored beyond the lot of most men, and has received from Heaven only
favors and blessings. In his house he has entertained whatever princes,
literati, or men of distinction have gone to or dwelt in Venice; for, to
say nothing of his excellence in art, he has always distinguished
himself by courtesy, hospitality, and rectitude.</p>

<p>Titian has had some rivals in Venice, but not of any great ability,
wherefore he has easily overcome them by the superiority of his art;
while he has also rendered himself acceptable to the gentlemen of the
city. He has gained a fair amount of wealth, his labors having always
been well paid; and it would have been well if he had worked for his
amusement alone during these latter years, that he might not have
diminished the reputation gained in his best days by works of inferior
merit, performed at a period of life when nature tends inevitably to
decline, and consequent imperfection.</p>

<p>In the year 1566, when Vasari, the writer of the present history, was at
Venice, he went to visit Titian, as one who was his friend, and found
him, although then very old, still with the pencils in his hand and
painting busily. Great pleasure had Vasari in beholding his works and in
conversing with the master.</p>

<p>It may be affirmed, then, that Titian, having adorned Venice, or rather
all Italy, and other parts of the world, with excellent paintings, well
merits to be loved and respected by artists, and in many things to be
admired and imitated also, as one who has produced, and is producing,
work of infinite merit; nay, such as must endure while the memory of
illustrious men shall remain.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<p>It has been given to some men to be not only great in the domain of art
by reason of that which they have themselves succeeded in producing, but
by reason of that which they have inspired other men to produce. They
have been not merely artists, but teachers, who by precept and example
have moulded the whole current and drift of artistic thought in the ages
and lands to which they have belonged. Among these lofty spirits, who
live through the centuries not only in what their hands once fashioned,
but still more in what they have inspired others to do, undoubtedly one
of the greatest is Albert Dürer. Justly reckoned as the representative
artist of Germany, he has the peculiar honor of having raised the craft
of the engraver to its true position, as one of the fine arts. As a
painter not unworthy to be classified with Titian and Raphael, his
contemporaries upon Italian soil, he poured the wealth of his genius
into woodcuts and copperplates, and taught men the practically
measureless capacity of what before his day had been a rudimentary art.</p>

<p>Dürer was born in Nuremberg on May 21, 1471. The family was of Hungarian
origin, though the name is German, and is derived from Thürer, meaning a
maker of doors. The ancestral calling of the family probably was that of
the carpenter. Albert Dürer, the father of the great artist, was a
goldsmith, and settled about 1460 in Nuremberg, where he served as an
assistant to Hieronymus Holper, a master goldsmith, whose daughter,
Barbara, he married in 1468. He was at the time forty years of age, and
she fifteen. As the result of the union eighteen children were born into
the world, of whom Albrecht was the second. The lad, as he grew up,
became a great favorite with his father, who appeared to discern in him
the promise of future ability. The feeling of attachment was
reciprocated in the most filial manner, and there are extant two
well-authenticated portraits of the father from the facile brush of the
son, one in the Uffizi at Florence, the other in the possession of the
Duke of Northumberland. It was the original intention of the father of
the artist that he should follow the craft of the goldsmith, but after
serving a period as an apprentice in his father's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page232" name="page232"></a>(p. 232)</span> shop, his
strong predilection for the calling of the painter manifested itself to
such a degree that the father reluctantly consented to allow the boy to
follow his natural bent, and placed him under the tutelage of Michael
Wohlgemuth, the principal painter of Nuremberg. Wohlgemuth was a
representative artist of his time, who followed his calling after a
mechanical fashion, having a large shop filled with apprentices who,
under his direction and with his assistance, busied themselves in
turning out for a small consideration altar-pieces and pictures of
martyrdoms, which were in vogue as necessary parts of decoration in
churches. Numerous examples of the work of Wohlgemuth and his
contemporaries survive, attesting, by the wealth of crudities and
unintended caricatures with which they abound, the comparatively low
stage of development attained by the art of the painter in Germany at
that day. According to Dürer, the period of his apprenticeship to
Wohlgemuth was spent profitably, and resulted in large acquisitions of
technical skill. The period of his preliminary training being ended, he
set forth upon his "Wanderjahre," and travelled extensively. Just what
points he visited cannot with certainty be determined. It is ascertained
beyond doubt that he visited Colmar, where he was hospitably entertained
by the family of Martin Schongauer, the greatest painter of his time on
German soil, but who had died shortly before the visit of Dürer. He also
visited Strasburg, and it is thought by many that he extended his
journeyings as far as Venice. In 1494 he returned to Nuremberg, and in
the month of July was married to Agnes Frey, the daughter of a
prosperous merchant of the city. He was twenty-three years of age, and
she somewhat younger. They lived together happily, though no children
were born to them, and it has been proved that the reputation which has
been given her, of being little better than a common scold, who
imbittered his life by her termagancy, is the creation of the ill temper
of one of the testy friends of Dürer, Willibald Pirkheimer, who, in the
spirit of spitefulness, besmirched her character in a letter which
unfortunately survives to this day, and in which he accuses her of
having led her husband a mad and weary dance by her temper. The reason
for this ebullition on the part of Pirkheimer appears to have been that,
after Dürer's death, she refused to give him a pair of antlers which had
belonged to her husband, and which Pirkheimer had set his heart upon
having.</p>

<p>Albert Dürer's Wedding.</p>
</div>

<p>The first eleven years of the married life of Dürer were spent in
Nuremberg, where he devoted himself with unremitting assiduity to the
prosecution of his art. During these years his powers unfolded rapidly,
and there are extant two notable pictures, which were undoubtedly
produced at this time, the triptych in the Dresden Gallery, and an
altar-piece which is in the palace of the Archbishop of Vienna, at Ober
St. Veit. These compositions, while remarkable in many respects, still
reveal the influence of his master, Wohlgemuth, and give evidence of
having been in part executed with the assistance of apprentices. In
fact, the peak-gabled house at the foot of the castle-mound in Nuremberg
was a picture factory like that of Wohlgemuth, in which, however, work
of a higher order than any hitherto produced in Germany was being turned
out. We know the names of four or five of those who served as
apprentices under Dürer at this time and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page233" name="page233"></a>(p. 233)</span> they are stars of
lesser magnitude in the constellation of German art. But Dürer was not
contented simply to employ his talents in the production of painted
altar-pieces, and we find him turning out a number of engravings, the
most noticeable among which are his sixteen great wood-cuts illustrating
the Apocalypse, which were published in 1498. The theme was one which
had peculiar fascinations for all classes at the time. The breaking up
of all pre-existing systems, the wonderful stirrings of a new life which
were beginning to be felt everywhere with the close of the Middle Age
and the dawning of the Renaissance, had filled the minds of men with
wonder, and caused them to turn to the writings of the Apocalyptic Seer
with keenest interest. A recent critic, commenting upon his work as
represented in these engravings, says: "The energy and undismayed
simplicity of his imagination enable him, in this order of creations, to
touch the highest point of human achievement. The four angels keeping
back the winds that they blow not, the four riders, the loosing of the
angels of the Euphrates to slay the third part of men&mdash;these and others
are conceptions of such force, such grave or tempestuous grandeur, in
the midst of grotesqueness, as the art of no other age or hand has
produced."</p>

<p>At this period Dürer was also engaged in experimenting upon the art of
copper-plate engraving, in which he restricted himself mainly to
reproducing copies of the works of other artists, among them those of
Jacopo de Barbari, a painter of the Italian school, who was residing in
Nuremberg, and who among other things gave the great artist instruction
in plastic anatomy. The influence of his instructor is plain, when we
compare engravings executed about 1504 with those published at a
previous date, and especially when we examine his design of the Passion
of our Lord painted in white upon a green ground, commonly known as "The
Green Passion," which is treasured in the Albertina at Prague. He also
during these twelve years finished seven of the twelve great wood-cuts
illustrating the passion, and sixteen of the twenty cuts which compose
the series known as "The Life of the Virgin." The activities of Dürer in
Nuremberg were temporarily interrupted by a journey to Italy, which he
undertook in the fall of the year 1505. What the immediate occasion for
undertaking this journey may have been is not plain, though it seems
most likely that one of his objects was to enable him to recuperate from
the effects of a protracted illness, from which he had suffered during
the summer of this year, and also incidentally to secure a market for
his wares in Venice, the commercial relationships of which with
Nuremberg were very close at this period. A German colony, composed
largely of Nuremberg factors and merchants, was located at this time in
Venice, and they had secured the privilege of dedicating a great
painting in the church of St. Bartholomew. The commission for the
execution of this painting was secured by Dürer. It represents the
adoration of the Virgin, but has been commonly known under the name of
"The Feast of the Rose Garlands." After having undergone many
vicissitudes, it is preserved to-day in a highly mutilated condition in
the monastery of Strachow, near Prague. Dürer's stay in Venice was
signalized not only by the production of this painting, but of three or
four <span class="pagenum"><a id="page234" name="page234"></a>(p. 234)</span> other notable works which still exist, and which reflect
the great influence upon him of the Italian school of painting, with
which he had attained familiarity. His stay in Venice lasted about a
year. In the fall of 1506, he returned to Nuremberg, and there remained
for the next fourteen years, engaged in the practice of his art. These
years were years of success and prosperity. His name and fame had spread
over the whole of Europe, and the greatest artists of the day were glad
to do him homage. Raphael said of him, when contemplating some of his
designs, "Truly this man would have surpassed us all, if he had the
masterpieces of ancient art constantly before his eyes as we have." A
friendly correspondence was maintained between the immortal Italian and
his German contemporary, and in his own country, all men, from the
emperor to the peasant, delighted to do honor to his genius, the
products of which were found alike in church and palace, and through his
printed designs in the homes of the humble poor.</p>

<p>The proud old imperial city of Nuremberg had gathered within its
battlemented walls a multitude of men who were distinguished not only
for their commercial enterprise and wealth, but many of whom were the
exponents of the literary and artistic culture of the time. Among the
men with whom Dürer found congenial companionship were Adam Krafft, the
sculptor; Veit Stoss, whose exquisite carvings in wood may reflect in
some measure in the wild luxuriance of the imagination which they
display, the restless, "dare-devil" spirit with which his biographers
invest him; Peter Vischer, the bronze founder; and last but not least.
Hans Sachs, the cobbler poet, whose quaint rhymes are a source of
delight to this day, and were a mighty force in the great work of the
Reformation, by which the fetters of mediæval traditions and
ecclesiastical abuse were thrown off by the German people.</p>

<p>Of the personal appearance of Dürer at this time, we are not left in
ignorance. A portrait of himself from his own hands has been preserved
and is well known. His features reveal refinement and great
intellectuality, united with grace, and his attire shows that he was not
oblivious to matters of personal adornment. After the fashion of the
time, his hair was worn in long and graceful ringlets, which fell in
heavy masses about his shoulders.</p>

<p>The first six years which followed his return from Venice were almost
wholly given to painting, and his productions give evidence of the fact
that he had dismissed from his employment the retinue of assistants and
apprentices, whom he had employed in his earlier years. From this period
date most of his great masterpieces, which are still preserved, among
them the "Adam and Eve," in the Pitti Palace; the "Ten Thousand Martyrs
of Nicomedia," in the Imperial Gallery, at Vienna; the "Adoration of the
Trinity," at the Belvedere, in Vienna; and "The Assumption of the
Virgin," the original of which was destroyed by fire more than three
hundred years ago, but of which a good copy is preserved at Frankfort.
To this period belong the portraits of Charlemagne and of the Emperor
Sigismund, which are preserved in the National German Museum at
Nuremberg.</p>

<p>Albert Dürer visits Hans Sachs.</p>
</div>

<p>But while prosecuting the work of the painter, he did not neglect the
art of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page235" name="page235"></a>(p. 235)</span> the engraver, and in 1511, brought out in complete
form his great book of woodcuts in folio, and began to develop that
marvellous art of etching which is indissolubly connected with his name.
Among the products of the etcher's needle which attest his activity in
this direction are those masterpieces which have for centuries been at
once the delight and the puzzle of artistic minds: the "Melancholia,"
"The Knight and the Devil," and "St. Jerome in his Cell." The most
reasonable explanation of these weird fancies is that they were intended
to represent in allegorical style the three temperaments&mdash;the
melancholic, the sanguine, and the phlegmatic. The Diet of Augsburg,
which was convened in 1518, gave Dürer a passing opportunity to depict
the lineaments of the Emperor Maximilian, who gave him several sittings,
and who manifested great interest in the painter. The death of the
emperor in the following year, the outbreak of an epidemic in Nuremberg,
together with the coronation of Charles V. at Aix-la-Chapelle, led Dürer
to undertake a journey to the Low Countries, in which he was accompanied
by his faithful wife. He was present at the coronation and was one of
the distinguished civilians whose appearance added dignity to the
occasion. His diary, in which he recounts his experiences upon this
journey, and which is accompanied by a multitude of wayside sketches, is
still preserved, and contains, besides the dry entries of his current
expenditures, most entertaining allusions to the distinguished people
whom he met, and who received him with the utmost cordiality.
Intermingled with these narrative details are outbursts of feeling,
which are provoked by passing political and ecclesiastical events, in
which he took a profound interest, though he never appears to have
committed himself with positive openness to the party of reform. His
sympathies are, however, clearly shown by his writings, as well as by
his works of art, to have been with the Reformers, and he lived on terms
of intimacy with Erasmus and Melancthon, of both of whom we have
portraits from his hand.</p>

<p>Dürer returned from the Netherlands in 1521, about the middle of July,
and the remaining years of his life were spent in the prosecution of the
art of the engraver, in painting, and in the effort to elucidate the
sciences of perspective, geometry, and fortification, upon all of which
he has left treatises.</p>

<p>His labors, though they had not brought with them great wealth, had
secured for him a competency, and the latter years of his life were
devoted more and more to labors which, while dignified, did not tend to
add greatly to his already magnificent reputation. These labors were
prosecuted in spite of ever-failing health. While in the Netherlands he
had contracted a malarial fever, the effects of which clung to him, in
spite of the best treatment which could be secured, and left him the
wreck of his former self. On April 6, 1528, death suddenly overtook him.
There was not even time to summon his friends to his side before his
spirit had fled. The city which had been his home from childhood was
filled with mourning. They took up his remains and gently laid them to
rest in the burial vault of his wife's family in the graveyard of the
Church of St. John, where the setting sun pours its last glowing beams
at evening over the low Franconian hill-tops. The vault has since been
changed and the last resting-place of the remains <span class="pagenum"><a id="page236" name="page236"></a>(p. 236)</span> of the
Raphael of the North is a lowly mound, reverently approached by all who
visit the quaint imperial city, upon which is a slab, covered with a
bronze tablet upon which are the words:</p>

<p class="poem30">
  Quicquid Alberti Dureri Mortale<br>
  Fuit Sub Hoc Conditum Tumulo.<br>
  Emigravit VIII Idus Aprilis, MDXXVIIL</p>

<p class="poem20">
  <span class="min03em">"</span><i>Emigravit</i> is the inscription on the tombstone where he lies;<br>
  Dead he is not, but departed&mdash;for the artist never dies.<br>
  Fairer seems the ancient city, and the sunshine seems more fair,<br>
  That he once has trod its pavement, that he once has breathed its air!"

(1577-1640)</h3>

<p>"It is just one hundred and twenty years to-day," said a young artist to
his friend, as he stood in the hall of St. Mark, at Venice,
contemplating the noble works of Titian. "Time, the destroyer, has here
stayed his hand; the colors are as vivid and as fresh as if they were
laid on but yesterday. Would that my old friend and master, Otho Venius,
was here! At least I will carry back to Antwerp that in my coloring
which shall prove to him that I have not played truant to the art."</p>

<p>"Just one hundred and twenty years," repeated he, "since Titian was
born. Venice was then in its glory, but now it is all falling; its
churches and palaces are crumbling to dust, its commerce interrupted.
The republic continually harassed by the Porte, and obliged to call on
foreign aid; depressed by her internal despotism, her council of ten,
and state inquisitors; her decline, though gradual, is sure; yet the
splendor of her arts remains, and the genius of Titian, her favorite
son, is yet in the bloom and brilliancy of youth!"</p>

<p>Such was the enthusiastic exclamation of Rubens, as he contemplated
those <span class="pagenum"><a id="page237" name="page237"></a>(p. 237)</span> paintings which had brought him from Antwerp. How many
gifted minds spoke to him from the noble works which were before him!
The three Bellinis, the founders of the Venetian school; Giorgione,
Titian, and Tintoretto. Then Paolo Veronese, who, though born at Verona,
in 1537, adopted Venice as his home, and became the fellow-artist of
Tintoretto, and the disciple of Titian. Pordenone, too, who viewed
Titian as a rival and an enemy. Palma the young, and Palma the old, born
in 1548, and the Bassanos, who died near 1627.</p>

<p>All these were present to the eye of Rubens, their genius embodied on
the canvas in the halls of St. Mark. "These," he exclaimed, "have formed
the Venetian school, and these shall be my study!"</p>

<p>From this time, the young artist might daily be seen with his sheets of
white paper, and his pencil in his hand. A few strokes preserved the
outline which his memory filled up; and by an intuitive glance, his
genius understood and appropriated every signal beauty.</p>

<p>In Venice he became acquainted with the Archduke Albert, who introduced
him to the Duke of Mantua, whither he went for the purpose of studying
the works of Julio Romano. From thence he proceeded to Rome; here
Raphael was his model, and Michael Angelo his wonder. He devoted himself
to painting with a fervor that belongs only to genius; and he soon
proved that, whatever he gained by ancient study, the originality of his
own conceptions would still remain and appear. To the vivid and splendid
coloring of the Venetian school, he was perhaps more indebted than to
any other model. The affectionate and constant intercourse, by letters,
that subsisted between Rubens and his mother, made his long residence in
Italy one of pleasure. At Rome he was employed to adorn, by his
paintings, the Church of Santa Croce, and also the "Chiesa Nova."</p>

<p>Rubens had been originally destined by his mother for one of the learned
professions. His father was born at Antwerp, and held the honorable
office of councillor of state. When the civil war broke out he repaired
to Cologne, where his son, Peter Paul Rubens, was born. He died soon
after his return to Antwerp, and left his property much diminished from
losses occasioned by the civil war. The mother of Rubens put him early
to the best schools, where he was initiated in learning and discovered a
taste for belles-lettres; but all the intervals of necessary study were
devoted to drawing. His mother perceiving it, determined to indulge his
inclination, and placed him in the studio of Van Noort.</p>

<p>The correct taste of the scholar soon led him to perceive that he could
not adopt this artist's style, and he became the pupil of Otho Venius.
Similarity of thought and feeling united them closely, and it was with
true disinterestedness that the master urged his pupil to quit his
confined circle and repair to Italy, the great school of art.</p>

<p>Time flew rapidly with Rubens, while engaged in his beloved and
honorable pursuit; he looked forward to the period when he might return
to Antwerp and place his mother in her former affluence. Nearly seven
years had passed since he took leave of her. Of late he thought her
letters had been less cheerful; she spoke of her declining health, of
her earnest hope that she might live to embrace <span class="pagenum"><a id="page238" name="page238"></a>(p. 238)</span> him once more.
This hint was enough for his affectionate heart. He immediately broke
off all his engagements and prepared to return. Everyone knows what
impatience is created when one first begins to contemplate home, after a
long absence, and the heart is turned toward it. "Seven years absent?"
wrote Rubens to his mother, "how is it possible I have lived so long
away from you? It is too long; henceforth I will devote myself to your
happiness. Antwerp shall be my future residence. I have acquired a taste
for horticulture; our little garden shall be enlarged and cultivated,
and our home will be a paradise."</p>

<p>What are human anticipations and projects! the day before he was to quit
Rome he received a letter informing him that his mother was very ill,
and begging him to return with all speed. With breathless haste he
hurried back, without sleep or rest. When he reached the city he dared
not make any inquiries. At length he stood before the paternal mansion;
he saw the gloomy tiles and half-closed window-shutters. It was the fall
of the trees. He observed people going in and out at the door; to speak
was impossible. At length he rushed in and heard the appalling sentence,
"Too late," a sentence that often strikes desolation to the human heart.
His mother had expired that morning.</p>

<p>While he was struggling with the bitterness of sorrow, he met with
Elizabeth Brants. There was something in the tone of her voice which
infused tranquillity into his mind, and affection came in a new form to
assuage his loss. She was the "ladye of his love," and afterward his
wife. He built a magnificent house at Antwerp, with a saloon in form of
a rotunda, which he ornamented and enriched with antique statues, busts,
vases, and pictures by the most celebrated painters. Thus surrounded by
the gems of art, he devoted himself to the execution of works which were
the pride of his native country, and caused honors and wealth to be
heaped upon him.</p>

<p>There were those found who could not endure the splendor of his success;
these calumniated. There were others who tried to draw him into
visionary speculations. A chemist offered him a share of his laboratory,
to join in his search for the philosopher's stone. He carried the
visionary to his painting-room, and said, "The offer comes too late. You
see I have found out the art of making gold by my palette and pencils."</p>

<p>Rubens was now at the height of prosperity and happiness, a dangerous
eminence, and one on which few are permitted to rest. A second time his
heart was pierced with sorrow: he lost his young wife, Elizabeth, a few
years after their union. Deep as was his sorrow, he had yet resolution
enough to feel the necessity of exertion. He left the place which
constantly reminded him of domestic enjoyment, the memory of which
contrasted so sadly with the present silence and solitude, and travelled
for some time in Holland. After his return, he received a commission
from Mary de Medici, of France, to adorn the palace of the Luxembourg.
He executed for this purpose a number of paintings at Antwerp, and
instructed several pupils in his art.</p>

<p>At this time Rubens devoted himself wholly to painting, and scarcely
allowed himself time for recreation. He considered it one of the most
effectual <span class="pagenum"><a id="page239" name="page239"></a>(p. 239)</span> means of instruction, to allow his pupils to observe
his method of using his paints. He therefore had them with him while
he worked on his large pictures. Teniers, Snyders, Jordaens, and Vandyke
were among his pupils&mdash;all names well known.</p>

<p>When Rubens had executed the commission given him by Mary de Medici,
wife of Henry IV., he repaired to Paris to arrange his pictures at the
Luxembourg palace, and there painted two more, and likewise the
galleries, representing passages of her life.</p>

<p>Here he became acquainted with the Duke of Buckingham, as that nobleman
was on his way to Madrid with Prince Charles. On his return to Antwerp,
he was summoned to the presence of the Infanta Isabella, who had,
through Buckingham, become interested in his character. She thought him
worthy of a political mission to the court of Madrid, where he was most
graciously received by Philip. While at Madrid he painted four pictures
for the convent of the Carmelites, and a fine portrait of the king on
horseback, with many other pictures; for these extraordinary productions
he was richly rewarded, received the honor of knighthood, and was
presented with the golden key.</p>

<p>While in Spain, Don John, Duke of Braganza, who was afterward king of
Portugal, sent and invited him to visit him at Villa Vitiosa, the place
of his residence. Rubens, perhaps, might at this time have been a little
dazzled with his uncommon elevation. He was now <i>Sir Paul</i> and
celebrated all over Europe. It was proper he should make the visit as
one person of high rank visits another. His preparations were great to
appear in a becoming style, and not to shame his noble host. At length
the morning arrived, and, attended by a numerous train of courteous
friends and hired attendants, the long cavalcade began the journey. When
not far distant from Villa Vitiosa, Rubens learned that Don John had
sent an embassy to meet him. Such an honor had seldom been accorded to a
private gentleman, and Rubens schooled himself to receive it with
suitable humility and becoming dignity.</p>

<p>He put up at a little distance from Villa Vitiosa, awaiting the arrival
of the embassy; finally it came, in the form of a single gentleman, who
civilly told him that the duke, his master, had been obliged to leave
home on business that could not be dispensed with, and therefore must
deny himself the pleasure of the visit; but as he had probably been at
some extra expense in coming so far, he begged him to accept of fifty
pistoles as a remuneration.</p>

<p>Rubens refused the pistoles, and could not forbear adding that he had
"brought two thousand along with him, which he had meant to spend at his
court during the fifteen days he was to spend there."</p>

<p>The truth was, that when Don John was informed that Rubens was coming in
the style of a prince to see him, it was wholly foreign to his plan; he
was a great lover of painting, and had wished to see him as an artist.
He therefore determined to prevent the visit.</p>

<p>The second marriage of Rubens, with Helena Forman, was, no less than the
first, one of affection; she had great beauty, and became a model for
his pencil. His favor with the great continued. Mary de Medici visited
him at his own <span class="pagenum"><a id="page240" name="page240"></a>(p. 240)</span> home more than once; and the Infanta Isabella
was so much satisfied with his mission in Spain, that she sent him to
England, to sound the disposition of the government on the subject of a
peace.</p>

<p>Rubens disclosed in this embassy his diplomatic talents; he first
appeared there in his character of artist, and insensibly won upon the
confidence of Charles. The king requested him to paint the ceiling of
the banqueting-house at Whitehall. While he was employed upon it,
Charles frequently visited him and criticised the work. Rubens, very
naturally introducing the subject, and finding, from the tenor of his
conversation, that he was by no means averse to a peace with Spain, at
length produced his credentials. The king received his mission most
graciously, and Rubens returned to the Netherlands crowned with honors
and success.</p>

<p>He had passed his fiftieth year when his health began to fail, and he
was attacked with a severe fit of the gout. Those who have witnessed the
irritation attendant upon that disorder will appreciate the perfect
harmony and gentleness that existed between Rubens and his wife. With
untiring tenderness she devoted herself to him, and was ingenious in
devising alleviations and comforts.</p>

<p>The severe attacks of Rubens' disorder debilitated his frame, yet he
continued painting at his easel almost to the last; and, amid suffering
and sickness, never failed in giving the energy of intellect to his
pictures. He died at the age of sixty-three, in the year 1640, leaving
great wealth. The pomp and circumstance of funeral rite can only be of
consequence as showing the estimation in which a departed citizen is
held. Public funeral honors were awarded, and men of every rank were
eager to manifest their respect to his memory. He was buried in the
Church of St. James, at Antwerp, under the altar of his private chapel,
which was decorated with one of his own noble pictures.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<p>A heretic in art Rembrandt was to many of his Dutch contemporaries; to
us, he is the master, supreme alike in genius and accomplishment.
Because, as time went on, he broke completely from tradition and in his
work gave full play to his originality, his pictures were looked at
askance; because he chose to live his own life, indifferent to accepted
conventions, he himself was misunderstood. It was his cruel fate to
enjoy prosperity and popularity in his earlier years, only to meet with
neglect in his old age. But this he felt probably less than other men;
he was not a courtier, with Velasquez, nor vowed to worldly success,
with Rubens. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page241" name="page241"></a>(p. 241)</span> His pleasure and his reward, he found in his
work. So long as easel and canvas, brushes and paints were left to him,
he demanded no greater happiness.</p>

</div>

<p>In Leyden, a town already made famous by another master, Lucas van
Leyden, Rembrandt was born in 1606; though this date has been disputed,
some authorities suggesting 1607, others, 1608. His family were
respectable, if not distinguished, burghers, his father, Harmen
Gerritszoon, being a miller by trade, his mother, Neeltjen Willems of
Zuitbroeck, the daughter of a baker. Not until early in the seventeenth
century did permanent surnames become common among Dutchmen; hitherto
children had been given their father's, in addition to their own
Christian name; Rembrandt for many years was known as Rembrandt
Harmenzoon, or the son of Harmen. But the miller, to be in the growing
fashion, had called himself Van Ryn&mdash;of the Rhine&mdash;and thus, later on,
Rembrandt also signed himself. Harmen was well-to-do; he owned houses in
Leyden, and beyond the walls, gardens, and fields, and the mill where
Rembrandt, because he once drew a mill, was supposed to have been born.
But there was no reason for Neeltjen to move from a comfortable house in
town into such rustic quarters, and it is more likely that Rembrandt's
birthplace was the house pointed out in the Nordeinde Street. A
commercial career had been chosen for his four older brothers. But
Harmen, his means allowing the luxury, decided to make of his fifth son
a man of letters and learning, and Rembrandt was sent to the University
of Leyden. That letters, however, had small charm for him, was clear
from the first. Better than his books he loved the engravings of
Swanenburch, better still, the pictures of Lucas van Leyden, which he
could look at to his heart's content on gala days, when the Town Hall,
where they hung, was thrown open to the public. His hours of study were
less profitable than his hours of recreation when he rambled in the
country, through his father's estate, and, sometimes as far as the sea,
a sketch-book, the chances are, for sole companion. Certainly, by the
time he was fifteen, so strong were the proofs of his indifference to
the classics and his love for art, that his father, sacrificing his own
ambitions, allowed Rembrandt to leave the university for the studio of
Van Swanenburch. From this day forth, his life's history is told in the
single word&mdash;work; his indeed was the genius of industry.</p>

<p>Van Swanenburch had studied in Italy; but his own painting, to judge by
the few examples still in existence, was entirely commonplace. Three
years were more than enough to be passed under his tuition. At the end
of the third, Rembrandt went to Amsterdam, and there entered the studio
of Lastman. His second master also had studied in Italy, and also was a
painter of mediocre talent, popular in his own times&mdash;the Apelles of the
day, he was called&mdash;but remembered now chiefly because of his relations
to his pupil. From the first, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name="page242"></a>(p. 242)</span> Rembrandt, even if obliged to
paint the stock subjects of the day, was determined to treat them in his
own way, and not to follow set forms that happened to be adopted in the
schools. He used real men and women for models, and painted them as he
saw them, not as he was bidden to look at them through his teacher's
spectacles. In six months he had learned at least one thing, that
Lastman had nothing more to teach him. The man of genius must ever be
his own master, though he remain the hard-working student all his days.
Back to Leyden and to his father's house, Rembrandt had not returned to
lead a life of idleness. He worked tremendously in these early years.
Even needed models he found in the members of his family; he has made
the face of his mother as familiar as that of a friend; his own, with
the heavy features, the thick, bushy hair, the small intelligent eyes,
between them the vertical line, fast deepening on the fine forehead, he
drew and etched and painted, again and again. More elaborate
compositions he also undertook. As in his maturity, it was to the Bible
he turned for suggestions: Saint Paul in prison, Samson and Delilah, the
Presentation in the Temple&mdash;these were the themes then in vogue which he
preferred, rendering them with the realism which distinguished his
later, more famous Samsons and Abrahams and Christs, making them the
motive for a fine arrangement of color, for a striking study of light
and shadow. A pleasant picture one can fancy of his life at this period;
he was with his own people, for whom his love was tender; busy with
brush, pencil, and etching-needle; he was strengthening his powers of
observation, developing and perfecting his style, occasionally producing
work that won for him renown in Leyden; and, gradually, he gathered
round him a small group of earnest fellow-workers, chief among them
Lievens, Gerard Dou, and Van Vliet, the last two, though but slightly
his juniors, looking up to him as master. These were the years of his
true apprenticeship.</p>

<p>Leyden, however, was not the best place for a young painter who had his
fortunes to make. It was essentially a university town; interest was
concentrated upon letters; art was but of secondary consideration. It
was different in Amsterdam, the great commercial centre of Holland.
There, all was life and activity and progress; there, was money to be
spent, and the liberal patron willing to lavish it upon the artist.
Holland just then was in the first flush of prosperity and patriotism,
following upon her virtual independence from Spain. Not a citizen but
glowed with self-respect at the thought of the victory he had, in one
way or another, helped to win; the state, as represented by the good
burghers, was supreme in every man's mind. It was natural that
individuals and corporations alike should seek to immortalize their
greatness by means of the painter's art, which, in Holland, had long
since ceased to be a monopoly of the church. Hence the age became
essentially one of portrait-painting. Many were the painters whose
portraits had already achieved distinction. De Keyser was busy in
Amsterdam; a far greater genius, Franz Hals, but fifteen years
Rembrandt's senior, was creating his masterpieces in The Hague and
Harlem. It was as inevitable that Rembrandt should turn to portraiture,
as that he should find commissions <span class="pagenum"><a id="page243" name="page243"></a>(p. 243)</span> less numerous in Leyden than
in Amsterdam. Often in the latter town his services were required; so
often, indeed, that at last, about 1631, when he was just twenty-five,
he settled there permanently and set up a studio of his own.</p>

<p>Success was his from the start. Sitter after sitter sought him out in
his house on the Bloemgracht; the most distinguished men in the town
hastened to patronize him. His work was liked by the burghers whom he
painted, its strength was felt by artists, whose canvases soon showed
its influence. Admirers crowded to his studio. He had not been in
Amsterdam a twelvemonth when, before he was yet twenty-six, he was
entrusted with an order of more than usual importance. This was the
portrait of Dr. Tulp and his class of surgeons: the famous "Lesson in
Anatomy" now in the Gallery at The Hague. The subject at the time was
very popular. Many artists, De Keyser among others, had already, in
painting prominent surgeons, placed them around the subject they were
dissecting; indeed, this was the arrangement insisted upon by the
surgeons themselves, and, as there seems to have been no limit to their
vanity, "Lessons in Anatomy" were almost as plentiful in Holland as
"Madonnas" in Umbria. Rembrandt in his composition was simply adhering
to accepted tradition. It is true that he instilled life into a group
hitherto, on other painters' canvases, stiff and perfunctory; but,
though the picture was a wonderful production for a man of his years, it
is not to be ranked with his greatest work.</p>

<p>Commissions now poured in still faster. It was at this time he painted
several of his best known portraits: the "Master Shipbuilder and his
Wife," at present in Buckingham Palace; that simply marvellous old woman
at the National Gallery in London, made familiar to everyone by
countless photographs and other reproductions; the man in ruff and woman
in coif at the Brunswick Museum; and a score of others scarce less
important. With increasing popularity, he was able to command his own
prices, so that only a part of his time was it necessary for him to
devote to the portraits which were his chief source of income. During
the leisure he reserved, he painted biblical subjects, ever his delight,
and made etchings and drawings, today the most prized treasures in the
world's great galleries. As in Leyden, he drew about him students; a
few, notably Ferdinand Bol and Christophe Paudiss, destined, in their
turn, to gain name and fame. Indifferent to social claims and honors&mdash;an
indifference the burghers, his patrons, found it hard to forgive, his
one amusement was in collecting pictures and engravings, old stuffs and
jewels, and every kind of <i>bric-à-brac</i>, until his house in Amsterdam
was a veritable museum. This amusement later was to cost him dear.</p>

<p>Four years after the "Lesson in Anatomy" was painted, when he was at the
height of prosperity, in 1634, he married Saskia van Uylenborch, the
Saskia of so many an etching and picture. She was of a good Frisian
family, and brought with her a dowry of no mean proportions. Rembrandt's
marriage made small changes in his way of living. Into the society, so
ready to receive him, he never went, not even now that he had a wife to
introduce. It bored him, and he was no toady to waste his time fawning
upon possible patrons. "When I desire to rest <span class="pagenum"><a id="page244" name="page244"></a>(p. 244)</span> my spirit, I do
not seek honors, but liberty," was his explanation. The companionship of
artists he always welcomed; sometimes he visited the humbler burghers,
whose ways were as simple as his own; sometimes he sought the humblest
classes of all, because of their picturesqueness, and his contemporaries
took him to task for his perverted taste for low company. The truth is
that always he devoted himself solely and wholly to his art; the only
difference, once he was married, was that, when he sat at his easel all
day or over his copperplate, and sketchbook all evening, Saskia was with
him. She shared all his interests, all his ambitions; she had no will
but his. During his working hours, she was his model, obedient to his
call. She never tired of posing for him, nor he of painting her now
simply as Saskia, now as Delilah feasting with Samson, as Susanna
surprised by the Elders, as the Jewish Betrothed at her toilet.
Sometimes he represented her alone, sometimes with himself at her side;
once, in the famous Dresden portrait, on his knee, as if to proclaim the
love they bore for one another. And he, who could render faithfully the
ways of the beggar, the austere black of the burgher, for himself and
Saskia found no masquerading too gay or extravagant. In inventing
costumes for their own portraits, he gave his exuberant fancy free play:
in gorgeous embroidered robes, waving plumes, and priceless gems they
arrayed themselves, until even the resources of his collection were
exhausted: the same rich mantle, the same jewels appear, and reappear in
picture after picture.</p>

<p>Rembrandt's short married years were happy, though not without their
sorrows. Of Saskia's five children, four died in infancy; the fifth,
Titus, was not a year old when, in 1642, the end came for Saskia, and
Rembrandt, who had just reached his thirty-seventh year, was left in his
great house alone with an infant son and his pupils. Her confidence in
him is shown by her will, in which the inheritance of Titus is left in
the father's charge, though already Rembrandt's affairs must have given
signs of coming complications.</p>

<p>Connoisseurs at Rembrandt's Studio.</p>
</div>

<p>Much of his best work remained to be done, but after Saskia's death his
worldly fortunes and his popularity never again touched such high-water
mark. The reason for this is not far to seek. During all these years,
Rembrandt's powers had matured, his methods broadened, and his
individuality strengthened. With each new canvas, his originality became
more conspicuous. It was not only that the world of nature, and not
imagination, supplied his models. Many of the Dutch painters now were no
less realists than he. It was not only that he solved certain problems
of <i>chiaro oscuro</i>, there were men, like Lievens, who were as eager as
he in the study of light and shadow. But Rembrandt brought to his every
experiment an independence that startled the average man. He painted
well because he saw well. If no one else saw things as he did, the loss
was theirs. But he paid for his keener vision; because he did not paint
like other artists, his methods were mistrusted. To be misunderstood is
the penalty of genius. The picture which, of all his work, is now the
most famous, marks the turn in the tide of his affairs. Shortly before
Saskia's death, he had been commissioned to paint a portrait group of
Banning Cock and the military company <span class="pagenum"><a id="page245" name="page245"></a>(p. 245)</span> which he commanded.
These portrait groups of the military corporations rivalled in
popularity the "Lessons in Anatomy." Each member, or officer, paid to be
included in the composition, and, as a rule, a stiff, formal picture,
with each individual posed as for a photograph, was the result.
Rembrandt, apparently, was in nowise restricted when he undertook the
work for Banning Cock, and so, instead of the stupid, hackneyed
arrangement, he made of the portrait of the company a picture of armed
men marching forth to beating of drums and waving of banners, "The
Night Watch," as it must ever be known&mdash;more accurately, "The Sortie of
the Company of Banning Cock"&mdash;now in the Ryks Museum of Amsterdam. With
the men for whom it was painted, it proved a failure. The grouping, the
arrangement displeased them. Many of the company were left in deep
shadow, which was not the privilege for which they had agreed to pay
good money. Rembrandt was not the man to compromise. After this many
burghers, who cared much for themselves and their own faces, and not in
the least for art, were afraid to entrust their portraits to him lest
their importance might be sacrificed to the painter's effects. Certain
it is that six years later, in 1648, when the independence of Holland
was formally recognized at the Congress of Westphalia, though Terburg
and Van der Heist celebrated the event on canvas, Rembrandt's services
were not secured. Good friends were left to him&mdash;men of intelligence who
appreciated his strong individuality and the great originality of his
work. Banning Cock himself was not among the discontented. A few leading
citizens, like Dr. Tulp and the Burgomeister Six, were ever his devoted
patrons. Artists still gathered about him; pupils still crowded to his
studio; Nicolas Maes, De Gelder, Kneller among them. Many of his finest
portraits&mdash;those of Hendrickje Stoffels, of his son, of himself in his
old age, of the Burgomeister Six, above all, his masterpiece, "The
Syndics of the Guild of Clothmakers," now in Amsterdam; many of his
finest etchings, the little landscapes, the famous "Hundred Guilder
Print," "Christ Healing the Sick," belong to this later period. There
was no falling off, but rather an increase, in his powers, despite the
clouds that darkened his years of middle age.</p>

<p>Of these clouds, the darkest was due to his financial troubles.
Rembrandt had made large sums of money; Saskia's dowry had been by no
means small. But he also spent lavishly. He had absolutely no business
capacity. Once he was accused of miserliness; that he would at times
lunch on dry bread and a herring served as reproach against him; there
was a story current that his pupils would drop bits of paper painted to
look like money in order to see him stoop to pick them up. Both charges
are too foolish to answer seriously. When he was at work, it mattered
little to him what he ate, so that he was not disturbed; who would not
stoop to pick up coins apparently scattered on the floor? The money he
devoted to his collection is sufficient to show how small a fancy he had
for hoarding; upon it a princely fortune had been squandered. To his own
people in Leyden, when times were hard, he had not been slow to hold out
a generous hand. It was because he was not enough of a miser, because
he gave too little heed to business matters, that difficulties at length
overwhelmed him. It <span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246"></a>(p. 246)</span> is too sad a story to tell in detail.
Perhaps the beginning was when he bought a house for which he had not
the ready money to pay, and borrowed a large sum for the purpose. More
and more involved became his affairs. In time his creditors grew
clamorous, and at length the blow fell when, in 1657, he was declared
bankrupt. The collection of years, the embroidered mantles and
draperies, the jewels with which Saskia had been so gayly decked, the
plumes and furs and gorgeous robes in which he himself had masqueraded,
the armor and plate, the engravings and pictures which had filled his
house&mdash;all were sold. He, the master, had, at the age of fifty-one, to
begin life anew as if he were still but the apprentice.</p>

<p>In the midst of his troubles and losses, Hendrickje Stoffels, whose
portrait hangs in the Louvre, was the friend who cheered and comforted
him. She had been his servant; afterward she lived with him as his wife,
though legally they were not married. To Titus, as to her own children,
she was ever a tender mother, and Titus, in return, seems to have loved
her no less well. In the end, they together took Rembrandt's business
interests into their own hands, the son, probably, using his inheritance
in the enterprise. Renting a house in their own name, they became his
print and picture dealers.</p>

<p>But as time went on, Rembrandt's work brought lower and lower prices,
and he, himself, the last two years of his life, was almost forgotten.
Though he still lived in Amsterdam, the town from which he had so seldom
journeyed, and then never far, he had fallen into such obscurity, that
report now established him in Stockholm as painter to the King of
Sweden, now in Hull, or Yarmouth. In his own family nothing but sorrow
was in store for him. Hendrickje died, probably about 1664, and he was
once more alone; and next he lost Titus, who then had been married but a
few short months.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Rembrandt, he did not long survive them. In 1669, at the
age of sixty-two, his release came. He was buried in the West Church,
quietly and simply. Thirteen florins his funeral cost, and even this
small expense had to be met by his daughter-in-law. When an inventory of
his possessions was taken, these were found to consist of nothing but
his own wardrobe and his painter's tools.</p>

<p>But better than a mere fortune, his work he left as an heirloom for all
time; his drawings, not the least among them without the stamp of his
genius; his prints, still unsurpassed, though it was he who first
developed the possibilities of etching; his pictures, "painted with
light," as Fromentin has said. His subjects he may have borrowed from
the fashions and traditions of the time; certain mannerisms of technique
and arrangement his pupils may have copied. But for all that, his work
belongs to no special school or group; like all the world's great
masterpieces, whether produced in Spain by a Velasquez, in Venice by a
Titian, in England by a Whistler, it stands alone and supreme.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page247" name="page247"></a>(p. 247)</span> WILLIAM HOGARTH<br>

(1697-1764)</h3>

<a id="img017" name="img017"></a>
<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img017.jpg" width="250" height="295" alt="William Hogarth." title="">
</div>

<p>"I was born," says Hogarth, in his Memoirs of himself, "in the city of
London, November 10, 1697. My father's pen, like that of many authors,
did not enable him to do more than put me in a way of shifting for
myself. As I had naturally a good eye and a fondness for drawing, shows
of all sorts gave me uncommon pleasure when an infant; and mimicry,
common to all children, was remarkable in me. An early access to a
neighboring painter drew my attention from play, and I was, at every
possible opportunity, employed in making drawings. I picked up an
acquaintance of the same turn, and soon learned to draw the alphabet
with great correctness. My exercises when at school were more remarkable
for the ornaments which adorned them than for the exercise itself. In
the former I soon found that blockheads with better memories could much
surpass me, but for the latter I was particularly distinguished."</p>

<p>To this account of Hogarth's childhood we have only to add that his
father, an enthusiastic and laborious scholar, who, like many of his
craft, owed little to the favor of fortune, consulted these indications
of talent as well as his means would allow, and bound his son apprentice
to a silver-plate engraver. But Hogarth aspired after something higher
than drawing ciphers and coats-of-arms; and before the expiration of his
indentures he had made himself a good draughtsman, and obtained
considerable knowledge of coloring. It was his ambition to become
distinguished as an artist; and not content with being the mere copier
of other men's productions, he sought to combine the functions of the
painter with those of the engraver, and to gain the power of delineating
his own ideas and the fruits of his acute observation. He has himself
explained the nature of his views in a passage which is worth attention:</p>

<p>"Many reasons led me to wish that I could find the shorter path&mdash;fix
forms and characters in my mind&mdash;and instead of copying the lines, try
to read the language, and, if possible, find the grammar of the art by
bringing into one focus the various observations I have made, and then
trying by my power on the canvas how far my plan enabled me to combine
and apply them to practice. For this purpose I considered what various
ways, and to what different purposes, the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page248" name="page248"></a>(p. 248)</span> memory might be
applied, and fell upon one most suitable to my situation and idle
disposition; laying it down first as an axiom, that he who could by any
means acquire and retain in his memory perfect ideas of the subjects he
meant to draw, would have as clear a knowledge of the figure as a man
who can write freely hath of the twenty-five letters of the alphabet and
their infinite combinations." Acting on these principles, he improved,
by constant exercise, his natural powers of observation and
recollection. We find him roaming through the country, now at Yarmouth
and again at Queenborough, sketching everywhere. In his rambles among
the motley scenes of London he was ever on the watch for striking
features or incidents; and not trusting entirely to memory, he was
accustomed, when any face struck him as being peculiarly grotesque or
expressive, to sketch it on his thumb-nail, to be treasured up on paper
at his return home.</p>

<p>For some time after the expiration of his apprenticeship, Hogarth
continued to practise the trade to which he was bred; and his
shop-bills, coats-of-arms, engravings upon tankards, etc., have been
collected with an eagerness quite disproportionate to their value. Soon
he procured employment in furnishing frontispieces and designs for the
booksellers. The most remarkable of these are the plates to an edition
of "Hudibras," published in 1726; but even these are of no distinguished
merit. About 1728 he began to seek employment as a portrait-painter.
Most of his performances were small family pictures, containing several
figures, which he calls "Conversation Pieces," from twelve to fifteen
inches high. These for a time were very popular, and his practice was
considerable, as his price was low. His life-size portraits are few; the
most remarkable are that of Captain Coram, in the "Foundling Hospital,"
and that of Garrick as King Richard III., which is reproduced in the
present volume. But his practice as a portrait-painter was not
lucrative, nor his popularity lasting. Although many of his likenesses
were strong and characteristic, in the representation of beauty,
elegance, and high-breeding he was little skilled. The nature of the
artist was as uncourtly as his pencil. When Hogarth obtained employment
and eminence of another sort through his wonderful prints, he abandoned
portrait-painting, with a growl at the jealousy of his professional
brethren; and the vanity and blindness of the public.</p>

<p>March 25, 1729, Hogarth contracted a stolen marriage with the only
daughter of the once fashionable painter, Sir James Thornhill. The
father, for some time implacable, relented at last; and the
reconciliation, it is said, was much forwarded by his admiration of the
"Harlot's Progress," a series of six prints, commenced in 1731 and
published in 1734. The novelty as well as merit of this series of prints
won for them extraordinary popularity; and their success encouraged
Hogarth to undertake a similar history of the "Rake's Progress," in
eight prints, which appeared in 1735. The third, and perhaps the most
popular, as it is the least objectionable of these pictorial novels,
"Marriage à la Mode," was not engraved till 1745.</p>

<a id="img018" name="img018"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img018.jpg" width="600" height="468" alt="" title="">
<p>Hogarth sketching the Highway of Queenborough.</p>
</div>

<p>The merits of these prints were sufficiently intelligible to the public:
their originality and boldness of design, the force and freedom of
their execution, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page249" name="page249"></a>(p. 249)</span> rough as it is, won for them an extensive
popularity and a rapid and continued sale. The "Harlot's Progress" was
the most eminently successful, from its novelty rather than from its
superior excellence. Twelve hundred subscribers' names were entered for
it; it was dramatized in several forms; and we may note, in illustration
of the difference of past and present manners, that fan-mounts were
engraved containing miniature copies of the six plates. The merits of
the pictures were less obvious to the few who could afford to spend
large sums on works of art, and Hogarth, too proud to let them go for
prices much below the value which he put upon them, waited for a long
time, and waited in vain, for a purchaser. At last he determined to
commit them to public sale; but instead of the common method of auction,
he devised a new and complex plan with the intention of excluding
picture-dealers, and obliging men of rank and wealth who wished to
purchase to judge and bid for themselves. The scheme failed, as might
have been expected. Nineteen of Hogarth's best pictures, the "Harlot's
Progress," the "Rake's Progress," the "Four Times of the Day," and
"Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn" produced only £427 7s., not
averaging £22 10s. each. The "Harlot's Progress" was purchased by Mr.
Beckford at the rate of fourteen guineas a picture; five of the series
perished in the fire at Fonthill. The "Rake's Progress" averaged
twenty-two guineas a picture; it has passed into the possession of Sir
John Soane, at the advanced price of five hundred and seventy guineas.
The same eminent architect became the proprietor of the four pictures of
an "Election" for the sum of £1,732. "Marriage à la Mode" was disposed
of in a similar way in 1750; and on the day of the sale one bidder
appeared, who became master of the six pictures, together with their
frames, for £115 10s. Mr. Angerstein purchased them, in 1797, for
£1,381, and they now form a striking feature in the National Gallery.</p>

<p>The satire of Hogarth was not often of a personal nature; but he knew
his own power, and he sometimes exercised it. Two of his prints, "The
Times," produced a memorable quarrel between himself, on one side, and
Wilkes and Churchhill, on the other. The satire of the prints of "The
Times," which were published in 1762, was directed, not against Wilkes
himself, but his political friends, Pitt and Temple; nor is it so biting
as to have required Wilkes, in defence of his party, to retaliate upon
one with whom he had lived in familiar and friendly intercourse. He did
so, however, in a number of the <i>North Briton</i>, containing not only
abuse of the artist, but unjust and injurious mention of his wife.
Hogarth was deeply wounded by this attack; he retorted by the well-known
portrait of Wilkes with the cap of liberty, and he afterward represented
Churchill as a bear. The quarrel was unworthy the talents either of the
painter or poet. It is more to be regretted because its effects, as he
himself intimates, were injurious to Hogarth's declining health. The
summer of 1764 he spent at Chiswick, and the free air and exercise
worked a partial renovation of his strength. The amendment, however, was
but temporary, and he died suddenly, October 26th, the day after his
return to his London residence in Leicester Square.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>



<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page250" name="page250"></a>(p. 250)</span> SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS<br>

By <span class="smcap">Samuel Archer</span><br>

(1723-1792)</h3>

<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img019.jpg" width="200" height="264" alt="Sir Joshua Reynolds." title="">
</div>

<p>Sir Joshua Reynolds, the celebrated painter, was, on July 16, 1723, born
at Plympton, a small town in Devonshire, England. His father was a
minister of the parish, and also master of the grammar school; and being
a man of learning and philanthropy, he was beloved and respected by all
to whom he was known. Such a man, it will naturally be supposed, was
assiduous in the cultivation of the minds of his children, among whom
his son Joshua shone conspicuous, by displaying at a very early period a
superiority of genius and the rudiments of a correct taste. Unlike other
boys, who generally content themselves with giving a literal explanation
of their author, regardless of his beauties or his faults, young
Reynolds attended to both these, displaying a happy knowledge of what he
read, and entering with ardor into the spirit of his author. He
discovered likewise talents for composition, and a natural propensity to
drawing, in which his friends and intimates thought him qualified to
excel. Emulation was a distinguishing characteristic of his mind, which
his father perceived with the delight natural to a parent; and designing
him for the church, in which he hoped that his talents might raise him
to eminence, he sent him to one of the universities.</p>

<p>Soon after this period he grew passionately fond of painting; and by the
perusal of Richardson's theory of that art was determined to make it his
profession through life. At his own earnest request, therefore, he was
removed to London; and about the year 1742 became a pupil to Mr. Hudson,
who, though not himself an eminent painter, was preceptor to many who
afterward excelled in the art. One of the first advices which he gave to
Mr. Reynolds was to copy carefully Guercino's drawings. This was done
with such skill, that many of the copies are said to be now preserved in
the cabinets of the curious as the originals of that very great master.</p>

<p>About the year 1749, Mr. Reynolds went to Italy under the auspices, and
in the company, of the late Lord (then Commodore) Keppel, who was
appointed to the command of the British squadron in the Mediterranean.
In this garden of the world, this magic seat of arts, he failed not to
visit the schools of the great masters, to study the productions of
different ages, and to contemplate with unwearied attention the various
beauties which are characteristic of each. His labor <span class="pagenum"><a id="page251" name="page251"></a>(p. 251)</span> here, as
has been observed of another painter, was "the labor of love, not the
task of the hireling;" and how much he profited by it is known to all
Europe.</p>

<p>Having remained about two years in Italy, and studied the language as
well as the arts of the country with great success, he returned to
England, improved by travel and refined by education. On the road to
London from the port where he landed, he accidentally found in the inn
where he lodged Johnson's life of Savage, and was so taken with the
charms of composition, and the masterly delineation of character
displayed in that work, that, having begun to read it while leaning his
arm on the chimney-piece, he continued in that attitude, insensible of
pain till he was hardly able to raise his hand to his head. The
admiration of the work naturally led him to seek the acquaintance of its
author, who continued one of his sincerest admirers and warmest friends
till 1784, when they were separated by the stroke of death.</p>

<p>The first thing that distinguished him after his return to his native
country was a full-length portrait of Commodore Keppel; which in polite
circles was spoken of in terms of the highest encomium, and testified to
what a degree of eminence he had arrived in his profession. This was
followed by a portrait of Lord Edgecombe, and a few others, which at
once introduced him to the first business in portrait-painting; and that
branch of the art he cultivated with such success as will forever
establish his fame with all descriptions of refined society. Having
painted some of the first-rate beauties of the age, the polite world
flocked to see the graces and the charms of his pencil; and he soon
became the most fashionable painter not only in England, but in all
Europe. He has indeed preserved the resemblance of so many illustrious
characters, that we feel the less regret at his having left behind him
so few historical paintings; though what he has done in that way shows
him to have been qualified to excel in both departments. The only
landscape, perhaps, which he ever painted, except those beautiful and
chaste ones which compose the backgrounds of many of his portraits, is
"A View on the Thames from Richmond," which in 1784 was exhibited by the
Society for Promoting Painting and Design in Liverpool.</p>

<p>In 1764 Mr. Reynolds had the merit of being the first promoter of that
club, which, having long existed without a name, became at last
distinguished by the appellation of the <i>Literary Club</i>. Upon the
foundation of the Royal Academy of Painting, Sculpture, and
Architecture, he was appointed president; and his acknowledged
excellence in his profession made the appointment acceptable to all the
lovers of art. To add to the dignity of this new institution, his
majesty conferred on the president the honor of knighthood; and Sir
Joshua delivered his first discourse at the opening of the Academy, on
January 2, 1769. The merit of that discourse has been universally
admitted among painters; but it contains some directions, respecting the
proper mode of prosecuting their studies, to which every student of
every art would do well to pay attention. "I would chiefly recommend
(says he) that an implicit obedience to the <i>rules of art</i>, as
established by the practice of the great masters, should be exacted from
the young students. That those models, which have passed through the
approbation of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page252" name="page252"></a>(p. 252)</span> ages, should be considered by them as perfect
and infallible guides, as subjects for their imitation, not their
criticism. I am confident that this is the only efficacious method of
making a progress in the arts; and that he who sets out with doubting
will find life finished before he becomes master of the rudiments. For
it may be laid down as a maxim, that he who begins by presuming on his
own sense, has ended his studies as soon as he has commenced them. Every
opportunity, therefore, should be taken to discountenance that false and
vulgar opinion, that rules are the fetters of genius. They are fetters
only to men of no genius; as that armor, which upon the strong becomes
an ornament and a defence, upon the weak and misshapen turns into a
load, and cripples the body which it was made to protect."</p>

<p>Each succeeding year, on the distribution of the prizes, Sir Joshua
delivered to the students a discourse of equal merit with this; and
perhaps we do not hazard too much when we say, that from the whole
collected, the lovers of belles-lettres and the fine arts will acquire
juster notions of what is meant by taste in general, and better rules
for acquiring a correct taste, than from the multitude of those volumes
which have been professedly written on the subject.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1785 he went to Brussels, where he expended about
£1,000 on the purchase of paintings which, having been taken from the
different monasteries and religious houses in Flanders and Germany, were
then exposed to sale by the command of the Emperor Joseph. Gainsborough
and he had engaged to paint each other's portrait; and the canvas for
both being actually stretched, Sir Joshua gave one sitting to his
distinguished rival; but to the regret of every admirer of the art, the
unexpected death of the latter prevented all further progress.</p>

<p>In 1790 he was anxiously desirous to procure the vacant professorship of
perspective in the academy for Mr. Bonomi, an Italian architect; but
that artist not having been yet elected an associate, was, of course, no
academician, and it became necessary to raise him to those positions, in
order to qualify him for being a professor. Mr. Gilpin being his
competitor for the associateship, the numbers on the ballot proved
equal, when the president, on his casting vote, decided the election in
favor of his friend, who was thereby advanced so far toward the
professorship. Soon after this, an academic seat being vacant, Sir
Joshua exerted all his influence to obtain it for Mr. Bonomi; but
finding himself out-voted by a majority of two to one, he quitted the
chair with great dissatisfaction, and next day sent to the secretary of
the academy a formal resignation of the office, which for twenty-one
years he had filled with honor to himself and to his country. His
indignation, however, subsiding, he suffered himself to be prevailed
upon to return to the chair, which, within a year and a half, he was
again desirous to quit for a better reason.</p>

<p>Finding a disease of languor, occasioned by an enlargement of the liver,
to which he had for some time been subject, increase, and daily
expecting a total loss of sight, he wrote a letter to the academy,
intimating his intention to resign the office of president on account of
bodily infirmities, which disabled him from executing the duties of it
to his own satisfaction. The academy received <span class="pagenum"><a id="page253" name="page253"></a>(p. 253)</span> this intelligence
with the respectful concern due to the talents and virtues of their
president, and either then did enter, or designed to enter, into a
resolution honorable to all parties, namely, that a deputation from the
whole body of the academy should wait upon him, and inform him of their
wish, that the authority and privileges of the office of president might
be his during his life, declaring their willingness to permit the
performance of any of its duties which might be irksome to him by a
deputy.</p>

<p>From this period Sir Joshua never painted more. The last effort of his
pencil was the portrait of the honorable Charles James Fox, which was
executed in his best style, and shows that his fancy, his imagination,
and his other great powers in the art which he professed, remained
unabated to the end of his life. When the last touches were given to
this picture,</p>

<p class="poem30">
  "The hand of Reynolds fell, to rise no more."</p>

<p>On Thursday, February 23, 1792, the world was deprived of this amiable
man and excellent artist, at the age of sixty-eight years; a man than
whom no one, according to Johnson, had passed through life with more
observations of men and manners. The following character of him is said
to be the production of Mr. Burke:</p>

<p>"His illness was long, but borne with a mild and cheerful fortitude,
without the least mixture of anything irritable or querulous, agreeably
to the placid and even tenor of his whole life. He had, from the
beginning of his malady, a distinct view of his dissolution, which he
contemplated with that entire composure which nothing but the innocence,
integrity, and usefulness of his life, and an unaffected submission to
the will of Providence, could bestow. In this situation he had every
consolation from family tenderness, which his tenderness to his family
had always merited.</p>

<p>"Sir Joshua Reynolds was, on very many accounts, one of the most
memorable men of his time; he was the first Englishman who added the
praise of the elegant arts to the other glories of his country. In
taste, in grace, in facility, in happy invention, and in richness and
harmony of coloring, he was equal to the great masters of the renowned
ages. In portrait he went beyond them; for he communicated to that
branch of the art in which English artists are the most engaged, a
variety, a fancy, and a dignity derived from the higher branches, which
even those who professed them in a superior manner did not always
preserve when they delineated individual nature. His portraits reminded
the spectator of the invention of history and the amenity of landscape.
In painting portraits he appears not to be raised upon that platform,
but to descend to it from a higher sphere. His paintings illustrate his
lessons, and his lessons seem to be derived from his paintings.</p>

<p>"He possessed the theory as perfectly as the practice of his art. To be
such a painter, he was a profound and penetrating philosopher.</p>

<p>"In full happiness of foreign and domestic fame, admired by the expert
in art, and by the learned in science, courted by the great, caressed
by sovereign <span class="pagenum"><a id="page254" name="page254"></a>(p. 254)</span> powers, and celebrated by distinguished poets, his
native humility, modesty, and candor never forsook him, even on surprise
or provocation; nor was the least degree of arrogance or assumption
visible to the most scrutinizing eye in any part of his conduct or
discourse.</p>

<p>"His talents of every kind&mdash;powerful from nature, and not meanly
cultivated in letters&mdash;his social virtues in all the relations and all
the habitudes of life, rendered him the centre of a very great and
unparalleled variety of agreeable societies, which will be dissipated by
his death. He had too much merit not to excite some jealousy, too much
innocence to provoke any enmity. The loss of no man of his time can be
felt with more sincere, general, and unmixed sorrow."<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h3>BENJAMIN WEST<br>

By <span class="smcap">Martha J. Lamb</span><a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5" title="Go to footnote 5"><span class="smaller">[5]</span></a><br>

</div>

<p>In the wilds of the new world, a century and a half ago, there was,
apparently, no spot less likely to produce a famous painter than the
Quaker province of Pennsylvania. And yet, when George Washington was
only six years old there was born, in the little town of Springfield,
Chester County, a boy whose interesting and remarkable career from
infancy to old age has provided one of the most instructive lessons for
students in art that America affords.</p>

<p>Perhaps Benjamin West's aptitude for picture-making in his infancy,
while he was learning to walk and to talk, did not exceed that of hosts
of other children, in like circumstances, in every generation since his
time. But many curious things were remembered and told of this baby's
performances after he had developed a decided talent for reproducing the
beautiful objects that captivated his eye. It was in the summer of 1745,
a few months before he was seven years old that his married sister came
home for a visit, bringing with her an infant daughter. The next morning
after her arrival, little Benjamin was left to keep the flies off the
sleeping baby, while his mother and sister went to the garden for
flowers. The baby smiled in its sleep, and the boy was captivated. He
must catch that smile and keep it. He found some paper on the table,
scrambled <span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255"></a>(p. 255)</span> for a pen, and with red and black ink made a hasty
but striking picture of the little beauty. He heard his mother
returning, and conscious of having been in mischief, tried to conceal
his production; but she detected and captured it, and regarded it long
and lovingly, exclaiming as her daughter entered, "He has really made a
likeness of little Sally!" She then caught up the boy in her arms, and
kissed instead of chiding him, and he&mdash;looking up encouraged&mdash;told her
he could make the flowers, too, if she would permit. The awakening of
genius in Benjamin West has been distinctly traced to this incident, as
the time when he first discovered that he could imitate the forms of
such objects as pleased his sense of sight. And the incident itself has
been aptly styled "the birth of fine arts in the New World."</p>

<p>The Quaker boy, in course of years, left the wilderness of America to
become the president of the Royal Academy in London. His irreproachable
character not less than his excellence as an artist, gave him commanding
position among his contemporaries. From first to last he was
distinguished for his indefatigable industry. The number of his pictures
has been estimated, by a writer in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, at three
thousand; and Dunlap says that a gallery capable of holding them would
be four hundred feet long, fifty feet wide, and forty feet high&mdash;or a
wall a quarter of a mile long.</p>

<p>The parents of Benjamin West were sincere and self-respecting, and in
the language of the times, well-to-do. His mother's grandfather was the
intimate and confidential friend of William Penn. The family of his
father claimed direct descent from the Black Prince and Lord Delaware,
of the time of King Edward III. Colonel James West was the friend and
companion in arms of John Hampden. When Benjamin West was at work upon
his great picture of the "Institution of the Garter," the King of
England was delighted when the Duke of Buckingham assured him that West
had an ancestral right to a place among the warriors and knights of his
own painting. The Quaker associates of the parents of the artist, the
patriarchs of Pennsylvania, regarded their asylum in America as the
place for affectionate intercourse&mdash;free from all the military
predilections and political jealousies of Europe. The result was a state
of society more contented, peaceful, and pleasing than the world had
ever before exhibited. At the time of the birth of Benjamin West the
interior settlements in Pennsylvania had attained considerable wealth,
and unlimited hospitality formed a part of the regular economy of the
principal families. Those who resided near the highways were in the
habit, after supper and the religious exercises of the evening, of
making a large fire in the hallway, and spreading a table with
refreshments for such travellers as might pass in the night, who were
expected to step in and help themselves. This was conspicuously the case
in Springfield. Other acts of liberality were performed by this
community, to an extent that would have beggared the munificence of the
old world. Poverty was not known in this region. But whether families
traced their lineage to ancient and noble sources, or otherwise, their
pride was so tempered with the meekness of their faith, that it lent a
singular dignity to their benevolence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page256" name="page256"></a>(p. 256)</span> The Indians mingled freely with the people, and when they paid
their annual visits to the plantations, raised their wigwams in the
fields and orchards without asking permission, and were never molested.
Shortly after Benjamin West's first efforts with pen and ink, a party of
red men reached and encamped in Springfield. The boy-artist showed them
his sketches of birds and flowers, which seemed to amuse them greatly.
They at once proceeded to teach him how to prepare the red and yellow
colors with which they decorated their ornaments. To these Mrs. West
added blue, by contributing a piece of indigo. Thus the boy had three
prismatic colors for his use. What could be more picturesque than the
scene where the untutored Indian gave the future artist his first lesson
in mixing paints! These wild men also taught him archery, that he might
shoot birds for models if he wanted their bright plumage to copy.</p>

<p>The neighbors were attracted by the boy's drawings, and finally a
relative, Mr. Pennington, a prominent merchant of Philadelphia, came to
pay the family a visit. He thought the boy's crude pictures were
wonderful, as he was then only entering his eighth year. When he went
home he immediately sent the little fellow a box of paints, with six
engravings by Grevling. John Gait, who wrote from the artist's own
statements, describes the effect of this gift upon the boy. In going to
bed he placed the box so near his couch, that he could hug and caress it
every time he wakened. Next morning he rose early, and taking his paints
and canvas to the garret, began to work. He went to breakfast, and then
stole back to his post under the roof, forgetting all about school. When
dinnertime came he presented himself at table, as usual, but said
nothing of his occupation. He had been absent from school some days
before the master called on his parents to inquire what had become of
him. This led to the discovery of his secret painting, for his mother
proceeded to the garret and found the truant. She was, however, so
astonished with the creation upon his canvas, that she took him in her
arms and kissed him with transports of affection. He had made a
composition of his own out of two of the engravings&mdash;which he had
colored from his ideas of the proper tints to be used&mdash;and so perfect
did the picture appear to Mrs. West that, although half the canvas
remained to be covered, she would not suffer the child to add another
touch with his brush. Sixty-seven years afterward, Mr. Gait saw this
production in the exact state in which it was left, and Mr. West himself
acknowledged that in subsequent efforts he had never been able to excel
some of the touches of invention in this first picture.</p>

<p>The first instruction in art which the artist received was from Mr.
William Williams, a painter in Philadelphia. Young West's first attempt
at portraiture was at Lancaster, where he painted "The Death of
Socrates" for William Henry, a gunsmith. He was not yet sixteen, but
other paintings followed which possessed so much genuine merit, that
they have been preserved as treasures. One of these is in possession of
General Meredith Reed, of Paris, France, a descendant of the signer.
West returned to his home in Springfield, in 1754, to discuss the
question of his future vocation. He had an inclination for military
life, and volunteered as a recruit in the old French war; but military
attractions vanished <span class="pagenum"><a id="page257" name="page257"></a>(p. 257)</span> among the hardships involved, and in 1756,
when eighteen years old, he established himself in Philadelphia as a
portrait-painter, his price being "five guineas a head." Two years later
he went to New York, where he passed eleven months, and was liberally
employed by the merchants and others. He painted the portrait of Bishop
Provoost, those of Gerardus Duyekinck and his wife&mdash;full length&mdash;one of
Mrs. Samuel Breese, and many others, which are in the families of
descendants, and characteristic examples of his early work.</p>

<p>In 1760 an opportunity offered for him to visit Rome, Italy. He carried
letters to Cardinal Albani and other celebrities, and as he was very
handsome and intelligent, and came from a far-away land about which hung
the perpetual charm of tradition and romance, he soon became the lion of
the day among the imaginative Italians. It was a novelty then for an
American to appear in the Eternal City, and the very morning after his
arrival a curious party followed his steps to observe his pursuit of
art. He remained in Italy until 1763, and while there he painted, among
others, his pictures of "Cimon and Iphigenia," and "Angelica and
Medora." His portrait of Lord Grantham excited much interest, and that
nobleman's introduction facilitated his visit to London, which proved so
prolific in results. There was no great living historical painter in
England just then; and at first there was no sale for West's pictures,
as it was unfashionable to buy any but "old masters." But the young
artist was undaunted, and presently attracted attention in high places.
His picture of "Agrippina Landing with the Ashes of Germanicus," painted
for Dr. Drummond, Archbishop of York, secured him the favor of George
III., and the commission from his majesty to paint the "Departure of
Regulus from Rome." His untiring industry and gentlemanly habits were
conspicuous, and may be regarded as among the great secrets of his
continual advance and public recognition. His "Parting of Hector and
Andromache," and "Return of the Prodigal Son," were among his notable
productions of this period. His "Death of General Wolfe" has been, says
Tuckerman, "truly declared to have created an era in English art, by the
successful example it initiated of the abandonment of classic costume&mdash;a
reform advocated by Reynolds, who glories in the popular innovation."
His characters were clad in the dress of their time. Reynolds said to
the Archbishop of York: "I foresee that this picture will not only
become one of the most popular, but will occasion a revolution in art."
It was purchased by Lord Grosvenor. Among the long list of paintings
executed by order of the king were "The Death of Chevalier Bayard;"
"Edward III. Embracing his Son on the Field of Battle at Cressy;" "The
Installation of the Order of the Garter;" "The Black Prince Receiving
the King of France and his Son Prisoners at Poictiers," and "Queen
Philippa Interceding with Edward for the Burgesses of Calais." West was
one of the founders, in 1768, of the Royal Academy, and succeeded Sir
Joshua Reynolds as president of the institution in 1792, which post he
held almost uninterruptedly until 1815.</p>

<p>In the year 1780 he proposed a series of pictures on the progress of
revealed religion, of which there were thirty-six subjects in all, but
he never executed but <span class="pagenum"><a id="page258" name="page258"></a>(p. 258)</span> twenty-eight of these, owing to the
mental trouble which befell the king. He then commenced a new series of
important works, of which "Christ Healing the Sick" was purchased by an
institution in Great Britain for £3,000, and was subsequently copied for
the Pennsylvania Hospital. "Penn's Treaty with the Indians" was painted
for Granville Penn, the scene representing the founding of Pennsylvania.
West wrote to one of his family that he had taken the liberty of
introducing in this painting the likeness of his father and his brother
Thomas. "That is the likeness of our brother," he says, "standing
immediately behind Penn, leaning on his cane. I need not point out the
picture of our father, as I believe you will find it in the print from
memory." Tuckerman says that the work which, in the opinion of many
critics, best illustrates the skill of West in composition, drawing,
expression, and dramatic effect, is his "Death on the Pale Horse." His
"Cupid," owned in Philadelphia, is one of his most effective pictures as
to color.</p>

<p>The full-length portrait of West, by Sir Thomas Lawrence, P.R.A.,
represents the great artist in his character as president of the Royal
Academy, delivering a lecture on "coloring" to the students. Under his
right hand may be noticed, standing on an easel, a copy of Raphael's
cartoon of the "Death of Ananias." The picture of West's face has been
considered a perfect likeness, but the figure somewhat too large and too
tall in its effects. A copy of this portrait was made by Charles R.
Leslie; and Washington Allston also painted a portrait of the artist.
There exists, it is said, a portrait of West from his own hand, taken
apparently at about the age of forty, three-quarter length, in Quaker
costume.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<h3>THORWALDSEN<br>

By <span class="smcap">Hans Christian Andersen</span><br>

(1770-1844)</h3>


<p>It was in Copenhagen, on November 19, 1770, that a carver of figures for
ships' heads, by name Gottskalk Thorwaldsen, was presented by his wife,
Karen Grönlund, the daughter of a clergyman in Jutland, with a son, who
at his baptism received the name of Bertel, or Albert.</p>

<p>The father had come from Iceland, and lived in poor circumstances. They
dwelt in <i>Lille Grönnegade</i> (Little Green Street), not far from the
Academy of Arts. The moon has often peeped into their poor room; she has
told us about it in "A Picture-book without Pictures":</p>

<a id="img022" name="img022"></a>
<div class="floatright">
<img src="images/img022.jpg" width="200" height="280" alt="Thorwaldsen." title="">
</div>

<p>"The father and mother slept, but their little son did not sleep; where
the flowered cotton bed-curtains moved I saw the child peep out. I
thought at first that he looked at the Bornholm clock, for it was finely
painted with red and green, and there was a cuckoo on the top; it had
heavy leaden weights, and the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page259" name="page259"></a>(p. 259)</span> pendulum with its shining brass
plate went to and fro with a 'tick! tick!' But it was not that he looked
at; no, it was his mother's spinning-wheel, which stood directly under
the clock; this was the dearest piece of furniture in the whole house
for the boy; but he dared not touch it, for if he did, he got a rap over
the fingers. While his mother spun, he would sit for hours together
looking at the buzzing spindle and the revolving wheel, and then he had
his own thoughts. Oh! if he only durst spin that wheel! His father and
mother slept; he looked at them, he looked at the wheel, and then by
degrees a little naked foot was stuck out of bed, and then another naked
foot, then there came two small legs, and, with a jump, he stood on the
floor. He turned round once more, to see if his parents slept; yes, they
did, and so he went softly, quite softly, only in his little shirt, up
to the wheel, and began to spin. The cord flew off, and the wheel then
ran much quicker. His mother awoke at the same moment; the curtains
moved; she looked out and thought of the brownie, or another little
spectral being. 'Have mercy on us!' said she, and in her fear she struck
her husband in the side; he opened his eyes, rubbed them with his hands,
and looked at the busy little fellow. 'It is Bertel, woman,' said he."</p>

<p>What the moon relates we see here as the first picture in Thorwaldsen's
life's gallery; for it is a reflection of the reality. Thorwaldsen has
himself, when in familiar conversation at Nysöe, told the author almost
word for word what he, in his "Picture-book," lets the moon say. It was
one of his earliest remembrances, how he, in his little short shirt, sat
in the moonlight and spun his mother's wheel, while she, dear soul, took
him for a little spectre.</p>

<p>A few years ago there still lived an old ship-carpenter, who remembered
the little, light-haired, blue-eyed boy, that came to his father in the
carving-house at the dock-yard; he was to learn his father's trade; and
as the latter felt how bad it was not to be able to draw, the boy, then
eleven years of age, was sent to the drawing-school at the Academy of
Arts, where he made rapid progress. Two years afterward, Bertel, or
Albert, as we shall in future call him, was of great assistance to his
father; nay, he even improved his work.</p>

<p>See the hovering ships on the wharves! The Dannebrog waves, the workmen
sit in circle under the shade at their frugal breakfasts; but foremost
stands the principal figure in this picture: it is a boy who cuts with a
bold hand the lifelike features in the wooden image for the beak-head of
the vessel. It is the ship's guardian spirit, and, as the first image
from the hand of Albert Thorwaldsen, it shall wander out into the wide
world. The eternally swelling sea should baptize it with its waters, and
hang its wreaths of wet plants around it.</p>

<p>Our next picture advances a step forward. Unobserved among the other
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page260" name="page260"></a>(p. 260)</span> boys, he has now frequented the Academy's school for six years
already, where, always taciturn and silent, he stood by his
drawing-board. His answer was "yes" or "no," a nod or a shake of the
head; but mildness shone from his features, and good-nature was in every
expression. The picture shows us Albert as a candidate for confirmation.
He is now seventeen years of age&mdash;not a very young age to ratify his
baptismal compact; his place at the dean's house is the last among the
poor boys, for his knowledge is not sufficient to place him higher.
There had just at that time been an account in the newspapers, that the
pupil Thorwaldsen had gained the Academy's smaller medal for a
bas-relief representing a "Cupid Reposing." "Is it your brother that has
gained the medal?" inquired the dean. "It is myself," said Albert, and
the clergyman looked kindly on him, placed him first among all the boys,
and from that time always called him Monsieur Thorwaldsen. Oh! how
deeply did that "Monsieur" then sound in his mind! As he has often said
since, it sounded far more powerfully than any title that kings could
give him; he never afterward forgot it.</p>

<p>In a small house in Aabeuraa&mdash;the street where Holberg lets his poor
poets dwell&mdash;lived Albert Thorwaldsen with his parents, and divided his
time between the study of art and assisting his father. The Academy's
lesser gold was then the prize to be obtained for sculpture. Our artist
was now twenty years of age; his friends knew his abilities better than
himself, and they compelled him to enter on the task. The subject
proposed was, "Heliodorus Driven out of the Temple."</p>

<p>We are now in Charlottenburg; but the little chamber in which
Thorwaldsen lately sat to make his sketch is empty, and he, chased by
the demons of fear and distrust, hastens down the narrow back-stairs
with the intention not to return. Nothing is accidental in the life of a
great genius; an apparent insignificance is a God's guiding finger.
Thorwaldsen was to complete his task. Who is it that stops him on the
dark stairs? One of the professors just comes that way, speaks to him,
questions, admonishes him. He returns, and in four hours the sketch is
finished, and the gold medal won. This was on August 15, 1791.</p>

<p>Count Ditlew de Reventlow, minister of state, saw the young artist's
work, and became his protector; he placed his own name at the head of a
subscription that enabled Thorwaldsen to devote his time to the study of
his art. Two years afterward the large gold medal was to be contended
for at the Academy, the successful candidate thereby gaining the right
to a travelling <i>stipendium</i>. Thorwaldsen was again the first; but
before he entered on his travels, it was deemed necessary to extend that
knowledge which an indifferent education at school had left him in want
of. He read, studied, and the Academy gave him its support;
acknowledgment smiled on him, a greater and more spiritual sphere lay
open to him.</p>

<p>A portrait figure stands now before us; it is that of a Dane, the
learned and severe Zoega, to whom the young artist is specially
recommended, but who only sees in him a common talent; whose words are
only those of censure, and whose eye sees only a servile imitation of
the antique in his works. Strictly honest in his judgment, according to
his own ideas, is this man, who should be Thorwaldsen's guide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page261" name="page261"></a>(p. 261)</span> We let three years glide away after the arrival of Thorwaldsen,
and ask Zoega what he now says of Albert, or, as the Italians call him,
Alberto, and the severe man shakes his head and says: "There is much to
blame, little to be satisfied with, and diligent he is not!" Yet he was
diligent in a high degree; but genius is foreign to a foreign mind. "The
snow had just then thawed from my eyes," he has himself often repeated.
The drawings of the Danish painter Carstens formed one of those
spiritual books that shed its holy baptism over that growing genius. The
little <i>atelier</i> looked like a battle-field, for roundabout were broken
statues. Genius formed them often in the midnight hours; despondency
over their faults broke them in the day.</p>

<p>The three years, for which he had received a <i>stipendium</i>, were as if
they had flown away, and as yet he had produced nothing. The time for
his return drew nigh. One work, however, he must complete, that it might
not with justice be said in Denmark, "Thorwaldsen has quite wasted his
time in Rome." Doubting his genius just when it embraced him most
affectionately; not expecting a victory, while he already stood on its
open road, he modelled "Jason who has Gained the Golden Fleece." It was
this that Thorwaldsen would have gained in the kingdom of arts, and
which he now thought he must resign. The figure stood there in clay,
many eyes looked carelessly on it, and&mdash;he broke it to pieces!</p>

<p>It was in April, 1801, that his return home was fixed, in company with
Zoega. It was put off until the autumn. During this time "Jason"
occupied all his thoughts. A new, a larger figure of the hero was
formed, an immortal work; but it had not then been announced to the
world, nor understood by it. "Here is something more than common!" was
said by many. Even the man to whom all paid homage, the illustrious
Canova, started, and exclaimed: "Quest' opera di quel giovane Danese è
fatta in uno stilo nuovo, e grandioso!" Zoega smiled. "It is bravely
done!" said he. The Danish songstress, Frederikke Brunn, was then in
Rome and sang enthusiastically about Thorwaldsen's "Jason." She assisted
the artist, so that he was enabled to get this figure cast in plaster;
for he himself had no more money than was just sufficient for his
expenses home.</p>

<p>The last glass of wine had been already drunk as a farewell, the boxes
packed, and the <i>vetturino's</i> carriage was before the door at daybreak;
the boxes were fastened behind. Then came a fellow-traveller&mdash;the
sculptor, Hagemann, who was returning to his native city, Berlin. His
passport was not ready. Their departure must be put off until the next
day; and Thorwaldsen promised, although the <i>vetturino</i> complained and
abused him, to remain so long. He stayed&mdash;stayed to win an immortal name
on earth, and cast a lustre over Denmark.</p>

<p>Though forty years resident in Rome, rich and independent, he lived and
worked with the thought of once returning home to Denmark, there to rest
himself; unaccustomed to the great comforts of other rich artists in
Rome, he lived a bachelor's life. Was his heart, then, no longer open to
love since his first departure from Copenhagen? A thousand beautiful
Cupids in marble will tell us how warmly that heart beat. Love belongs
to life's mysteries.</p>

<p>We know that Thorwaldsen left a daughter in Rome, whose birth he
acknowledged; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page262" name="page262"></a>(p. 262)</span> we also know that more than one female of quality
would willingly have given her hand to the great artist. The year before
his first return to Denmark he lay ill at Naples, and was nursed by an
English lady who felt the most ardent affection for him; and, from that
feeling of gratitude which was awakened in him, he immediately consented
to their union. When he had recovered and afterward returned to Rome,
this promise preyed on his mind, he felt that he was not now formed to
be a husband, acknowledged that gratitude was not love, and that they
were not suited for each other; after a long combat with himself, he
wrote and informed her of his determination. Thorwaldsen was never
married.</p>

<p>The following trait is as characteristic of his heart as of his whole
personality. One day, while in Rome, there came a poor countryman to
him, an artisan, who had long been ill. He came to say farewell, and to
thank him for the money that he and others of his countrymen had
subscribed together, with which he was to reach home.</p>

<p>"But you will not walk the whole way?" said Thorwaldsen.</p>

<p>"I am obliged to do so," replied the man.</p>

<p>"But you are still too weak to walk&mdash;you cannot bear the fatigue, nor
must you do it!" said he.</p>

<p>The man assured him of the necessity of doing so.</p>

<p>Thorwaldsen went and opened a drawer, took out a handful of <i>scudi</i> and
gave them to him, saying, "See, now you will ride the whole way!"</p>

<p>The man thanked him, but assured him that his gift would not be more
than sufficient to carry him to Florence.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Thorwaldsen, clapping him on the shoulder, as he went a
second time to the drawer and took out another handful. The man was
grateful in the highest degree, and was going. "Now you can ride the
whole way home and be comfortable on the way," said he, as he followed
the man to the door.</p>

<p>"I am very glad," said the man. "God bless you for it! but to ride the
whole way requires a little capital."</p>

<p>"Well, then, tell me how great that must be," he asked, and looked
earnestly at him. The man in a modest manner named the requisite sum,
and Thorwaldsen went a third time to the drawer, counted out the sum,
accompanied him to the door, pressed his hand, and repeated, "But now
you will ride, for you have not strength to walk!"</p>

<p>Our artist did not belong to the class of great talkers; it was only in
a small circle that he could be brought to say anything, but then it was
always with humor and gayety. A few energetic exclamations of his are
preserved. A well-known sculptor, expressing himself one day with much
self-feeling, entered into a dispute with Thorwaldsen, and set his own
works over the latter's. "You may bind my hands behind me," said
Thorwaldsen, "and I will bite the marble out with my teeth better than
you can carve it."</p>

<p>Thorwaldsen possessed specimens in plaster of all his works; these,
together with the rich marble statues and bas-reliefs which he had
collected of his own <span class="pagenum"><a id="page263" name="page263"></a>(p. 263)</span> accord, without orders, and the number of
paintings that he every year bought of young artists, formed a treasure
that he wished to have in his proper home, Copenhagen. Therefore, when
the Danish government sent vessels of war to the Mediterranean, in order
to fetch the works that were ready for the palace or the churches, he
always sent a number of his own things with them. Denmark was to inherit
these treasures of art; and, in order to see them collected in a place
worthy of them, a zeal was awakened in the nation to build a museum for
their reception. A committee of his Danish admirers and friends sent out
a requisition to the people, that everyone might give their mite; many a
poor servant-girl and many a peasant gave theirs, so that a good sum was
soon collected. Frederick VI. gave ground for the building, and the
erection thereof was committed to the architect, Bindesbol.</p>

<p>Thorwaldsen, in 1838, had attained universal fame. The frigate Rota was
dispatched to bring a cargo of his works to Copenhagen, and he was to
arrive at the same time, perhaps to remain in Denmark. Close to Presto
Bay, surrounded by wood-grown banks, lies Nysöe, the principal seat of
the barony of Stampenborg, a place which, through Thorwaldsen, has
become remarkable in Denmark. The open strand, the beautiful beech
woods, even the little town seen through the orchards, at some few
hundred paces from the mansion, make the place worthy of a visit on
account of its truly Danish scenery. Here Thorwaldsen found his best
home in Denmark; here he seemed to increase his fame, and here a series
of his last beautiful bas-reliefs were produced.</p>

<p>Baron Stampe was one of nature's noblest-minded men; his hospitality and
his lady's daughterly affection for Thorwaldsen opened a home for him
here, a comfortable and good one. A great energetic power in the
baroness incited his activity; she attended him with a daughter's care,
elicited from him every little wish, and executed it. Directly after his
first visit to Nysöe, a short tour to Moen's chalk cliffs was arranged,
and during the few days that were passed there, a little <i>atelier</i> was
erected in the garden at Nysöe, close to the canal which half encircles
the principal building; here, and in a corner room of the mansion, on
the first floor facing the sea, most of Thorwaldsen's works, during the
last years of his life, were executed: "Christ Bearing the Cross," "The
Entry into Jerusalem," "Rebecca at the Well," his own portrait-statue,
Oehlenschlæger's and Holberg's busts, etc. Baroness Stampe was in
faithful attendance on him, lent him a helping hand, and read aloud for
him from Holberg. Driving abroad, weekly concerts, and in the evenings
his fondest play, "The Lottery," were what most easily excited him, and
on these occasions he would say many amusing things. He has represented
the Stampe family in two bas-reliefs: in the one, representing the
mother, the two daughters, and the youngest son, is the artist himself;
the other exhibits the father and the two eldest sons.</p>

<p>All circles sought to attract Thorwaldsen; he was at every great
festival, in every great society, and every evening in the theatre by
the side of Oehlenschlæger. His greatness was allied to a mildness, a
straightforwardness, that in the highest degree fascinated the stranger
who approached him for the first <span class="pagenum"><a id="page264" name="page264"></a>(p. 264)</span> time. His <i>atelier</i> in
Copenhagen was visited daily; he therefore felt himself more comfortable
and undisturbed at Nysöe. Baron Stampe and his family accompanied him to
Italy in 1841, when he again visited that country. The whole journey,
which was by way of Berlin, Dresden, Frankfort, the Rhine towns, and
Munich, was a continued triumphal procession. The winter was passed in
Rome, and the Danes there had a home in which they found a welcome.</p>

<p>The following year Thorwaldsen was again in Denmark, and at his favorite
place, Nysöe. On Christmas eve he here formed his beautiful bas-relief,
"Christmas Joys in Heaven," which Oehlenschlæger consecrated with a
poem. The last birthday of his life was celebrated here; the performance
of one of Holberg's vaudevilles was arranged, and strangers invited; yet
the morning of that day was the homeliest, when only the family and the
author of this memoir, who had written a merry song for the occasion,
which was still wet on the paper, placed themselves outside the artist's
door, each with a pair of tongs, a gong, or a bottle on which they
rubbed a cork, as an accompaniment, and sung the song as a morning
greeting. Thorwaldsen, in his morning gown, opened the door, laughing;
he twirled his black Raphael's cap, took a pair of tongs himself, and
accompanied us, while he danced round and joined the others in the loud
"hurra!"</p>

<p>A charming bas-relief, "The Genius of Poetry," was just completed; it
was the same that Thorwaldsen, on the last day of his life, bequeathed
to Oehlenschlæger, and said, "It may serve as a medal for you."</p>

<p>On Sunday, March 24, 1844, a small party of friends were assembled at
the residence of Baron Stampe, in Copenhagen. Thorwaldsen was there and
was unusually lively, told stories, and spoke of a journey that he
intended to make to Italy in the course of the summer. Cahn's tragedy of
"Griseldis" was to be performed for the first time that evening at the
theatre. Tragedy was not his favorite subject, but comedy, and
particularly the comedies of Holberg; but it was something new that he
was to see, and it had become a sort of habit with him to pass the
evening in the theatre. About six o'clock, therefore, he went to the
theatre alone. The overture had begun; on entering he shook hands with a
few of his friends, took his usual seat, stood up again to allow one to
pass him, sat down again, bent his head, and was no more! The music
continued. Those nearest to him thought he was only in a swoon, and he
was borne out; but he was numbered with the dead.</p>

<p>The mournful intelligence of his death soon spread through the country
and through all lands; funeral dirges were sung and funeral festivals
were arranged in Berlin and Rome; in the Danish theatre, whence his soul
took its flight to God there was a festival; the place where he sat was
decorated with crape and laurel wreaths, and a poem by Heiberg was
recited, in which his greatness and his death were alluded to.</p>

<p>The day before Thorwaldsen's death the interior of his tomb was
finished, for it was his wish that his remains might rest in the centre
of the court-yard of the museum; it was then walled round, and he begged
that there might be a marble edge around it, and a few rose-trees and
flowers planted on it as his monument. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page265" name="page265"></a>(p. 265)</span> The whole building, with
the rich treasures which he presented to his fatherland, will be his
monument; his works are to be placed in the rooms of the square building
that surrounds the open court-yard, and which, both internally and
externally, are painted in the Pompeian style. His arrival in the roads
of Copenhagen and landing at the custom-house form the subjects depicted
in the compartments under the windows of one side of the museum. Through
centuries to come will nations wander to Denmark; not allured by our
charming green islands, with their fresh beech-woods alone&mdash;no, but to
see these works and this tomb.</p>

<p>There is, however, one place more that the stranger will visit, the
little spot at Nysöe where his <i>atelier</i> stands, and where the tree
bends its branches over the canal to the solitary swan which he fed. The
name of Thorwaldsen will be remembered in England by his statues of
Jason and Byron; in Switzerland, by his "recumbent lion;" in Roeskilde,
by his figure of Christian the Fourth. It will live in every breast in
which a love of art is enkindled.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

</div>

<p>We read that on one occasion, when a picture by some Dutch artist,
representing peasants at their sports, was shown to Louis XIV., he
angrily exclaimed, "Take away those vermin!" Such subjects had never
been chosen by French artists, nor indeed had they been seen anywhere in
Europe before the Dutch artists began to paint them in the seventeenth
century. The Italian painters of the early and the later Renaissance,
working almost exclusively for the churches, or for the palaces of
pleasure-loving princes, did not consider the peasant or the laboring
man, by himself, a proper subject for his art. If he were introduced at
any time into picture or bas-relief, it was only as a necessary actor in
some religious story, such as "The Adoration of the Shepherds," or in
the representations of the months or the seasons, as in the Fountain of
the Public Square at Perugia, where we see the peasant engaged in the
labors of the farm or vineyard: cutting the wheat, gathering in the
grapes, and treading out the wine, and, in the later season, dressing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page266" name="page266"></a>(p. 266)</span> the hog he has been killing; for in those less sophisticated
times, Art, no more than Poetry, despised the ruder side of rustic life.</p>

<p>The German artists of the sixteenth century introduced peasants and
peasant-life into their designs whenever the subject admitted. Albert
Dürer was especially given to this, and it often gives a particular
savor, sometimes a half-humorous expression, to his treatment of even
religious subjects; as where, in his design, "The Repose in Egypt," he
shows Joseph, the foster-father of Jesus, making a water-trough out of a
huge log, and a bevy of cherub-urchins about him gathering up the chips.
Mary, meanwhile, as the peasant mother, sits by, spinning and rocking
the cradle of the Holy Child with her foot.</p>

<p>But these examples only serve to make clearer the fact that in the
earlier times there was no place found in art for the representation of
the laboring man, whether in the field or in the shop, except as an
illustration of some allegorical or religious theme. Nor in the Dutch
pictures that Louis XIV. despised, and that our own time finds so
valuable for their artistic qualities, was there anything outside of
their beauty or richness of tone or color to redeem their coarseness and
vulgarity. There was no poetry in the treatment, nor any sympathy with
anything higher than the grossest guzzling, fighting, and horseplay. The
great monarch, who, according to his lights, was a man of delicacy and
refinement, was certainly right in contemning such subjects, and it is
perhaps to his credit that he did not care enough for "Art for Art's
sake" to excuse the brutality of the theme for the sake of the beauty of
the painting.</p>

<p>The next appearance of the peasant in art was of a very different sort,
and represented a very different state of social feeling from the
"peasants" of the Dutch painters. In the Salon of 1850 there appeared a
picture called "The Sower" and representing a young peasant sowing
grain. There was nothing in the subject to connect it particularly with
any religious symbolism&mdash;not even with the Parable of the Sower who went
forth to sow; nor with any series of personifications of the months.
This was a simple peasant of the Norman coast, in his red blouse and
blue trousers, his legs wrapped in straw, and his weather-beaten hat,
full of holes. He marches with the rhythmic step made necessary by his
task, over the downs that top the high cliffs, followed by a cloud of
crows that pounce upon the grain as he sows it. At first sight there
would seem to be nothing in this picture to call for particular notice;
but the public, the artists, the critics, were with one accord strongly
drawn to it. Something in the picture appealed to feelings deeper than
mere curiosity, and an interest was excited such as did not naturally
belong to a picture of a man sowing a field of grain. The secret was
this: that a man born and bred in the midst of laboring people,
struggling with the hard necessities of life&mdash;himself a laborer, and one
who knew by experience all the lights and shades of the laborer's
life&mdash;had painted this picture out of his own deep sympathy with his
fellows, and to please himself by reproducing the most significant and
poetical act in the life of the farmer.</p>

<p>The painter of this picture, the first man of our time to give the
laborer in the fields and on the farm a place in art, and to set people
to thinking about him, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page267" name="page267"></a>(p. 267)</span> as a man, not merely as an illustration
of some sacred text, or an image in a book of allegories, was
Jean-François Millet, known as the peasant painter of peasants.</p>

<p>He was born at Gruchy, a small hamlet on the coast of Normandy, where
his family, well known in the region for several generations, lived by
the labor of their hands, cultivating their fields and exercising the
simple virtues of that pastoral life, without ambition and without
desire for change. This content was a part of the religion of the
country and must not be looked upon as arguing a low state of
intelligence or of manners. Of their neighbors we have no account, but
the Millet household contained many of the elements that go to sustain
the intellectual no less than the spiritual life. If there was plain
living, there was high thinking; there were books and of the best, and
more than one member of the circle valued learning for its own sake.
Millet owed much to his grandmother, a woman of great strength of
character and of a deeply religious nature. As his godmother she gave
him his name, calling him Jean, after his father, and François, after
Saint Francis of Assisi. As is usual in Catholic countries, the boy was
called after the name of his patron saint, and in the case of Millet,
Saint Francis, the ardent lover of nature, the friend of the birds and
of all the animate creation, was well chosen as the guardian of one who
was to prove himself, all his life, the passionate lover of nature.</p>

<p>The boyhood of Millet was passed at home. He had no schooling except
some small instruction in Latin from the village priest and from a
neighboring curate, but he made good use of what he learned. He worked
on the farm with his father and his men, ploughing, harrowing, sowing,
reaping, mowing, winnowing&mdash;in a word, sharing actively and contentedly
in all the work that belongs to the farmer's life. And in the long
winter evenings or in the few hours of rest that the day afforded, he
would hungrily devour the books that were at hand&mdash;the "Lives of the
Saints," the "Confessions of Saint Augustine," the "Life of Saint
Jerome," and especially his letters, which he read and re-read all his
life. These and the philosophers of Port Royal, with Bossuet, and
Fénelon, with the Bible and Virgil, were his mental food. Virgil and the
Bible he read always in the Latin; he was so familiar with them both
that, when a man, his biographer, Sensier, says he never met a more
eloquent translator of these two books. When the time came, therefore,
for Millet to go up to Paris, he was not, as has been said by some
writer, an ignorant peasant, but a well-taught man who had read much and
digested what he had read, and knew good books from bad. The needs of
his narrow life absorbed him so seriously that the seeds of art that lay
hid in his nature found a way to the light with difficulty. But his
master-passion was soon to assert itself, and, as in all such cases, in
an unexpected manner.</p>

<p>Millet's attempts at drawing had hitherto been confined to studies made
in hours stolen from rest. He had copied the engravings found in an old
family Bible, and he had drawn, from his window, the garden, the stable,
the field running down to the edge of the high cliff, and with the sea
in the horizon, and he <span class="pagenum"><a id="page268" name="page268"></a>(p. 268)</span> had sometimes tried his hand at
sketching the cows and sheep in the pasture. But he was now to take a
step in advance. Coming home one day from church, he walked behind an
old man bent with age and feebleness, painfully making his way. The
foreshortening and the movement of the man's figure struck the boy
forcibly, and in a flash he discovered the secret of perspective and the
mystery of planes. He ran quickly home, got a pencil and drew from
memory a picture of the old man, so lively in its resemblance that as
soon as his parents saw it, they recognized it and fell a-laughing. Talk
with his boy revealed to the father his son's strong desire to be an
artist; but before such a serious step could be taken, it was necessary
to consult with some person better able to judge than any one in the
Millet household. Cherbourg, the nearest large town, was the natural
place where to seek advice; thither Millet and his father repaired, the
boy with two drawings under his arm that he had made for the occasion,
and these were submitted to the critical eye of Mouchel, an old pupil of
David, who eked out the scanty living he got by painting by giving
lessons in drawing. When the two drawings made by young Millet were
shown him he refused to believe they were the work of the lad of
fifteen. The very subjects chosen by the boy showed something out of the
common. One was a sort of home idyl: two shepherds were in a little
orchard close, one playing on the flute, the other listening; some sheep
were browsing near. The men wore the blouse and wooden shoes of Millet's
country; the orchard was one that belonged to his father. The other
drawing showed a starry night. A man was coming from the house with
loaves of bread in his hand which he gave to another man who eagerly
received them. Underneath, in Latin, were the words from St. Luke:
"Though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend, yet
because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he
needeth." A friend of Millet's, who saw these drawings thirty years
after, said they were the work of a man who already knew the great
significance of art, the effects it was capable of, and what were its
resources.</p>

<p>Mouchel consented to receive Millet as a pupil, but, as it proved, he
could do little for him in the way of direct teaching. He left the boy
free to follow his own devices. He said to him: "Do whatever you wish;
choose whatever model you find in my studio that pleases you, and study
in the Museum." This might not be the course to follow with every boy,
but Mouchel had the artist's penetration and knew with whom he had to
deal.</p>

<p>The death of Millet's father interrupted his studies and he returned
home for awhile to help his mother on the farm. But it was thought best
that he should keep on with the work he had begun. The grandmother urged
his return: "My François," she said, "we must accept the will of God.
Thy father, my son, Jean-Louis, said that you were to be a painter; obey
him, and go back to Cherbourg."</p>

<p>Millet did not need persuasion from his family. Friends in Cherbourg
urged him to come back, promised him commissions, and assured him a
place in the studio of Langlois, a painter of a higher grade than
Mouchel, who had recently set up his easel in the town. Once more
established at Cherbourg Millet continued <span class="pagenum"><a id="page269" name="page269"></a>(p. 269)</span> his studies after the
same easy fashion with Langlois as with his former master. Langlois, who
was as much impressed by his pupil's talent as Mouchel had been and
willing to serve him, made a personal appeal to the mayor and council,
asking that Millet, as a promising young artist and one likely to do
credit to the town, might be assisted in going to Paris to study under
better advantages than he could enjoy at home.</p>

<p>On the strength of this appeal, the council of Cherbourg agreed to allow
Millet an annuity of four hundred francs, equal to eighty dollars. With
this small sum, and the addition of two hundred francs given him at
parting by his mother and grandmother, making one hundred and twenty
dollars in all, Millet left his quiet life in Normandy behind him and
set out for Paris, where, as his biographer, Sensier, says, he was to
pass as a captive the richest years of his life.</p>

<p>Millet was twenty-two years old when he went first to Paris and he
remained there, with occasional visits to Gruchy and Cherbourg, for the
next thirteen years. Paris was, from the first, more than distasteful to
him. He was thoroughly unhappy there. Outside the Louvre and the studios
of a few artist-friends, he found nothing that appealed to what was
deepest in him. His first experiences were unusually bitter. The
struggle with poverty was hard to bear, but perhaps a more serious
drawback was his want of an aim in art, of a substantial reason, so to
speak, for the profession he had chosen, leading him to one false move
after another in search of a subject. Unformed and unrecognized in his
mind lay the desire to express in art the life he had left behind him in
Normandy; but it was long before he arrived at the knowledge of himself
and of his true vocation. He seems to have had no one in Paris to guide
or direct him, and he rather stumbled into the studio of Delaroche, than
entered it deliberately. He made but a brief stay there, and although he
won the respect of his master, who would willingly have retained him as
pupil and assistant, he was conscious that he learned nothing from
Delaroche; and accordingly, in company with another pupil, Marolles, who
had taken a great liking to him, he left the studio without much
ceremony; and the two friends improvised a studio and a lodging for
themselves in a garret in a poor quarter of the city, and began their
search for a means of pleasing the public. But the way was not opened to
either of them; they could not sell what they painted, and they were
reduced to serious straits. It was not the fault of the public. Marolles
was but an indifferent painter at any time, and Millet would not have
blamed the public for its indifference to subjects in which he himself
took no real interest.</p>

<p>Millet was at a loss what to do for bread. His mind ran back continually
to his rural life at Gruchy. "What if I should paint men mowing or
winnowing?" he said to Marolles; "their movements are picturesque!" "You
could not sell them," replied his friend. "Well, then, what do you say
to fauns and dryads?" "Who in Paris cares for fauns and dryads?" "What
shall I do, then?" said Millet in despair. "What does the public like?"
"It likes Boucher's Cupids, Watteau's Pastorals, nudities, anecdotes,
and copies of the past." It was hard for Millet, but hunger drove him.
He would not appeal to his <span class="pagenum"><a id="page270" name="page270"></a>(p. 270)</span> family, life was as difficult for
them as for him. But before yielding he would make one more trial,
painting something from his own fancy. He made a small picture
representing "Charity"&mdash;a sad-faced woman cherishing three children in
her arms. He carried it to the dealers: not one of them would buy it. He
came back to Marolles. "Give me a subject," he said, "and I will paint
it."</p>

<p>To this time belong the pictures for which Millet has been much
criticised by people who did not appreciate his position. Some of them
recall Watteau, others Boucher, but they have a charm, a grace of their
own; they are far from being copies of these men. Others were fanciful
subjects to which Marolles gave names likely to attract the notice of
picture-buyers in search of a subject. But all was in vain. The dealers
were obstinate: the public unsympathetic. The highest price that was
offered was never above twenty francs, or five dollars. Yet with this in
his pocket, Millet deemed himself already on the high road to fortune,
and saw the day not distant when he could paint at his pleasure the
rustic subjects, memories of his home, that had always been in his mind.</p>

<p>Several times in the course of this hard novitiate, Millet had escaped
from Paris for a visit to his own country. At one time he had remained
for a year at Cherbourg, where he painted portraits for such small sums
as he could get, and here he and one of his sitters, a young girl of
Cherbourg, falling in love with one another, were married. The marriage
only added, as might have been foreseen, to Millet's troubles: his
wife's health was always delicate; after her marriage it became worse,
and she died four years after in Paris. Not long after her death Millet
married again, and this proved a fortunate venture. His wife came with
him to Paris, and the struggle with life began anew. The turning-point
in the long period of Millet's uncertainties and disappointments with
himself came in 1849, when the political troubles of the time, and the
visit of the cholera, combined to drive him and his family from Paris.
They took refuge at Barbizon, a small hamlet on the outskirts of the
Forest of Fontainebleau, and here, in the place that was to be forever
associated with his name and work, Millet passed, with few
interruptions, the remaining years of his life.</p>

<p>The phrase so often heard to-day, "The Barbizon School," is rather wider
than a strict interpretation would warrant, since Millet and Rousseau
were the only ones of the group who lived in the village. Corot was not
acquainted with Millet. Decamps was never in Millet's house except as a
rare visitor to his studio. Diaz lived in Paris. Jacque, the painter of
sheep, was a friend of Millet, and for a time at least lived at Barbizon
in the house where he lodged before he procured a home of his own. The
artistic relationship between these artists is slight, except in the
case of Rousseau and Diaz, and even there it is only occasionally to be
detected. All these men, with Dupré, Courbet and Delacroix, were counted
heretics in art by the Academy and the official critics, and as Millet
was the most marked figure in the group and was greatly admired and
respected by all who composed it, it was perhaps natural that they
should be considered by the public as disciples of the peasant painter
of Barbizon.</p>

<p>Here, then, at Barbizon, Millet lived for the remaining twenty-seven
years of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page271" name="page271"></a>(p. 271)</span> his life, dividing his day between the labors of his
farm in the morning hours, painting in his studio in the afternoon&mdash;he
always preferred the half-light for painting&mdash;and in the evening
enjoying the society of his wife and children and of such friends as
might join the circle. Occasional visits to Paris, to the galleries, and
to the studios of his artist-circle, kept him in touch with the world to
which he belonged. His books, too, were his unfailing companions, though
he never cared to stray far beyond the circle of his youthful
friendships, Homer, and Virgil, and especially the Bible, which he
looked upon as the book of painters, the inexhaustible source of the
noblest and most touching subjects, capable of expression in the
grandest forms.</p>

<p>But it was in the rural life about him, the life in which he actively
shared, that he found the world wherein he could pour all his thoughts,
feelings, and experiences with the certainty of seeing them emerge in
forms answering to his conception. It was not until he came to Barbizon
that he began truly to live the artist-life as he understood it, where
the work is a faithful reflection of the only things a man really cares
for&mdash;the things he knows by heart. In the pictures painted at Barbizon,
and in the multitude of slight sketches for subjects never painted, with
finished drawings and pastels, Millet has composed a series of moral
eclogues well worthy of a place with those of Virgil and Theocritus. All
the world knows them; all the world loves them: the "Mother Feeding Her
Children," "The Peasant Grafting," "The First Step," "Going to Work,"
"The Sower," "The Gleaners," "The Sheep-Shearing," "The Angelus"&mdash;even
to name them would carry us far beyond our limits. They made the fame of
Millet while he still lived, although the pecuniary reward of his labors
was not what they deserved nor what it would have been had he earlier
found his true way or had his life been prolonged to the normal limit.
He died in 1875 at the age of sixty-one. Since his death more than one
of his pictures has been sold at a price exceeding all that he earned
during his whole lifetime. Seen from the world's side, there was much in
his life that was sad and discouraging, but from the spiritual side
there was far more to cheer and uplift. His private life was honorable
and happy, his friends were many and among the chosen ones of the time,
and he had the happiness of seeing his work accepted and rated at
something like its true worth before he left it.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<p>Among the many beautiful paintings collected in the Metropolitan Museum
of Art of New York, there is one that always attracts a crowd, on the
free-days and holidays when the general public finds admission. This is
the picture called simply, "Friedland: 1807," and representing the
soldiers of Napoleon saluting the emperor at the battle of Friedland. It
was painted by Jean Louis Meissonier for the late A. T. Stewart, of New
York, who paid for it what seemed a very large sum, $60,000; but when
Mr. Stewart died, and his pictures were sold at auction, this painting
brought the still larger sum of $66,000, showing that a great many
people admired the work, and were willing to pay a good price for it.
The picture was bought by Judge Hilton, of New York, and was presented
by him to the Metropolitan Museum as a memorial of the long friendship
that had existed between himself and Mr. Stewart. No doubt the facts of
the high price paid for the picture, and that a gift of such value
should be made to the Museum, have caused a great many people to look at
the painting with more interest than they would, had the circumstances
been less uncommon. But a great many more people find this picture
interesting for its own sake; they are moved rather by the spirited way
in which it tells its story, and find their curiosity excited by the
studious accuracy shown by the artist in the painting of every detail.</p>

<p>The scene of the action is a field that has been planted with grain
which now lies trampled under the feet of men and horses. The
turning-point in the battle has been reached, and in the joy of coming
victory, the body-guard of the emperor, spurring their jaded horses to
the hillock where he sits on his white charger surrounded by his mounted
staff, salute him with loud cries as they rush madly by him. Napoleon,
calm and self-possessed, returns the salute, but it is plain his
thoughts are busier with the battle that is raging in the distance than
with these demonstrations of his body-guard's loyalty. This picture was
the favorite work of the artist; he calls it, "the life and joy of my
studio," and he is said to have worked on it at intervals during fifteen
years.</p>

<a id="img025" name="img025"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img025.jpg" width="600" height="412" alt="" title="">
<p>Meissonier's Atelier.</p>
</div>

<p>Somebody has said that "genius" means nothing but "taking pains." In
that case, Meissonier must have been a man of genius, for, with
whatever he painted, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name="page273"></a>(p. 273)</span> were it small or great, he took infinite
pains, never content until he had done everything in his power to show
things exactly as they were. Thus, in the picture we have just been
describing, we may be sure that we know, from looking at it, exactly how
Napoleon was dressed on the day of Friedland, and also how each member
of his military staff was dressed; not a button, nor a strap, nor any
smallest detail but has been faithfully copied from the thing itself,
while every head in the group is a trustworthy portrait. When it was not
possible to get the actual dress worn by the person he was painting,
Meissonier spared no pains nor money to obtain an exact copy. How it was
in the case of the "Friedland," we do not know, but when he painted the
"March to Paris," Meissonier borrowed from the Museum, in Paris, where
relics of all the kings of France are kept (the <i>Musée des Souverains</i>),
the famous "little gray riding-coat" worn by Napoleon at the battle of
the Pyramids and in other engagements. This coat, Meissonier had copied
by a tailor, with the minutest accuracy, and it was then worn by the
model while he was painting the picture. The same pains were taken with
the cuirassiers who are dashing across the front of the picture in the
"Friedland." As will be seen on looking closely, one model served for
all the men in the front rank, but as the uniform was the same it was
only necessary to vary the attitude. The uniform and all the
accoutrements were carefully reproduced by workmen from originals of the
time, borrowed by Meissonier for the purpose, and the model was then
mounted on a jointed wooden horse and made to take the attitude
required: the action of the horse was as carefully studied from that of
the living animal. By the time that Meissonier came to paint this
picture, he was so famous an artist, and had gained such a place in the
world, that he could have almost anything he asked for to aid him in his
work. So, when, with the same desire for accuracy that he had shown in
painting other parts of the picture, he came to paint the trampled
grain, the Government, or so we are told, bought the use of a field of
ripe grain and lent Meissonier the services of a company of cuirassiers
who were set to dashing about in it until they had got it into proper
condition. We can see that the cost of all this accuracy would, in the
end, amount to a considerable sum, and when we reckon the time of an
artist so distinguished as Meissonier, it is not so surprising as it may
have appeared at first, that his picture should have brought so much
money.</p>

<p>Of course, Meissonier did not come all at once to fame and prosperity.
The rewards he gained were such as are earned only by hard and constant
labor. When he came to Paris about the year 1832, from Lyons, where he
was born, he was about nineteen years old. His parents were in humble
circumstances, and would seem to have been able to do nothing to advance
the lad, who arrived in Paris with little money in his pocket, and with
no friends at hand. He had, however, the materials out of which friends
and money are made: health, a generous spirit, energy, and a clear
purpose, and with these he went to work. We do not hear much about his
early life in Paris. When he first appears in sight, he is working in
the same studio with Daubigny, the landscape-painter, the two painting
pictures for a dollar the square yard, religious pictures probably, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page274" name="page274"></a>(p. 274)</span> probably also copies, to be sent into the country and hung up
in the parish churches. Although this may have seemed like hardship at
the time, yet there is no doubt it was good practice, for among artists
we are told it is an accepted doctrine that in order to paint on a small
scale really well, you must be able to paint on a larger. And it is said
that Meissonier was in the habit all his life of making life-size
studies in order to keep his style from falling into pettiness. So,
after all, the painting of these big pictures may have been a useful
ordeal for the artist who for the next sixty years was to reap fame by
painting small ones.</p>

<p>While he was earning a scanty living by this hack-work, Meissonier found
time to paint two pictures which he sent to the Salon of 1836. One of
these attracted the attention of a clever artist, Tony Johannot, who
introduced him to Léon Cogniet, with whom he studied for a time, but
from whom he learned but little. The mechanism of his art he had pretty
well mastered already, as was shown by the Salon accepting his early
pictures, and the chief advantage he gained from his stay in Cogniet's
studio was a wider acquaintance with the world of artists; for Cogniet
was a favorite teacher, and had a great many pupils, not a few of whom
became distinguished painters. But his style of painting was not one to
attract Meissonier, who was ambitious to paint like the old Dutch
artists, Terburg, Metzu, Mieris, and others, who have the charm that
their pictures are finished with the most exquisite minuteness, and yet
treated in such a large way that, after awhile, we forget the
microscopic wonder of the performance and think only of the skill the
artist has shown in painting character. Meissonier was the first artist
to bring back into favor the Dutch school of painting of the seventeenth
century. Louis XIV., who set the fashion in everything in his day, had
set the fashion of despising the Dutch painters, and the French people
had never unlearned the lesson. It was Meissonier who brought back the
taste, and taught the public to admire these small panels where interest
in the subject is for the most part lost in the exquisite beauty of the
painting and where the Dutch painters of similar subjects are
successfully met on their own ground and equalled in every respect
except in the charm of color.</p>

<p>There is an old saying: "Imitation is the sincerest mode of flattery;"
and Meissonier's immediate success with the public was the signal for a
bevy of imitators to try to win a like success by like methods. Some of
these artists were very clever, but an imitator is but an imitator after
all, and is more apt to call attention to his model than to himself. It
must be admitted that Meissonier himself has suffered somewhat in the
same way: the evident fact that his methods of painting were inspired by
the study of the Dutch masters has led to his being called an imitator,
and his pictures are often compared, and not to their advantage, with
those of his models. Meissonier is, however, very much more than an
imitator; he was inspired by the Dutch painters, but he soon found a way
of his own, and he has put so much of himself into his work, that the
charge of imitation long since ceased to be brought against him.</p>

<p>While he was still not much known to the public, the Duke of Orleans
bought of him, for six hundred francs, a picture that to-day is worth
thirty thousand <span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name="page275"></a>(p. 275)</span> francs. As is usual in such affairs, the
purchase was made, not by the duke in person, but by an agent: in this
case, it was his secretary, M. Adaline, who bought the picture from
Meissonier, who as an acknowledgment of the service gave the secretary a
water-color drawing which, to-day, like everything coming from the hand
of Meissonier, would bring the owner a good round sum if offered for
sale.</p>

<p>In 1865, Meissonier's son Charles, himself a very good painter, went to
a costume-ball dressed like a Fleming of the seventeenth century and
looking as if he had stepped out of a picture by Terburg. The costume
had been made with the greatest accuracy, and Meissonier was so pleased
with his son's appearance that he made a study and sold it for two
thousand francs. Twenty years after, in 1884, hearing that it was to be
sold at auction, and desiring, out of affection for his son, to have the
study back again, he asked his friend, M. Petit, to buy it for him, at
whatever cost. A rich Parisian, M. Secretan, who had a collection of
pictures since become famous&mdash;it was to him that Millet's "L'Angelus"
belonged&mdash;and who had such an admiration for Meissonier and his work
that he had paid no less than four hundred thousand francs for his
picture "Les Cuirassiers," hearing from M. Petit of Meissonier's desire
for the portrait of his son, bought the picture for twenty-five thousand
francs and presented it to the artist. These stories are told only as
illustrations of the growth of Meissonier's reputation and of the
increased number of people who desire to have an example of his work.
The rise in value of a small sketch of a single figure, from $500 to
$5,000, in fifteen years, is no greater in proportion than has happened
in the case of every one of Meissonier's pictures, drawings, studies,
and even his slight sketches, on some of which originally he would have
placed no value at all. Yet everything he left behind him, even
unconsidered trifles, are found to be of value, and the sale of the
contents of his studio just ended in Paris brought nearly five hundred
thousand francs, although the collection contained not a single finished
picture of importance, but was made up almost entirely of unfinished
studies and of sketches.</p>

<p>Meissonier's industry was constant and untiring. It is told of him that
he rarely had the pencil or the brush out of his hand when in the house,
and that when he called at a friend's house and was kept waiting he used
the spare minutes in sketching upon the first piece of paper that he
found at hand. One of his friends, who knew of this habit, collected in
the course of many visits he received from the artist enough of these
scraps to fill a small album; while it is told of another of his friends
that he instructed his servant to put beside Meissonier's coffee-cup
after dinner a number of bits of paper of the size of cigarette-papers
but of better quality on which Meissonier in his absent way would fall
to drawing as he chatted with his companions. After dinner these
jottings remained as a valuable memorial of his visit. Perhaps if they
were all collected, these slight affairs might bring enough at auction
to pay for all the dinners to which the prudent host had invited the
artist.</p>

<p>The world of subjects included in Meissonier's art was a very narrow
one, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page276" name="page276"></a>(p. 276)</span> was not calculated to interest men and women in
general. The nearest that he came to striking the popular note was in
his Napoleon subjects, and beside the excellence of the painting, these
pictures really make a valuable series of historical documents by reason
of their accuracy. But the greater number of the pictures which he left
behind him are chiefly interesting from the beautiful way in which they
are painted: we accept the subject for the sake of the art. The world
rewarded him for all this patient labor, this exquisite workmanship, by
an immense fortune that enabled him to live in splendor, and to be
generous without stint. From the humble lodgings of his youth in the Rue
des Ecouffes, he passed, in time, to the palace in the Place Malsherbes
where he spent the latter half of his long life in luxurious
surroundings: pictures and statues, rich furniture, tapestries and armor
and curiosities of art from every land. But the visitor, after passing
through all this splendor, came upon the artist in a studio, ample and
well lighted indeed, but furnished only for work, where, to the end of
his life, he pursued his industrious calling with all the energy and
ardor of youth. He died in 1891, and was buried by the government with
all the honors that befitted one of her most illustrious citizens.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<h3>ROSA BONHEUR<a id="footnotetag8" name="footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8" title="Go to footnote 8"><span class="smaller">[8]</span></a><br>

By <span class="smcap">Clarence Cook</span><br>

(BORN 1822)</h3>


<p>A girl of something over ten, of sturdy build, with a dark complexion,
deep blue eyes, and strong features crowned by a head of clustering
curls, is sitting in the window of a plainly furnished room, high up in
an apartment-house in Paris. In a cage at her side is a parrot, which,
with its head on one side, is gravely calling out the letters of the
alphabet, while the child as gravely repeats them, interrupting the
lesson every now and then by a visit to the other side of the room,
where a pet lamb greets its young mistress with a friendly bleat.</p>

<p>This is our first glimpse of Rosalie, known now to all the world as Rosa
Bonheur, the painter of "The Horse Fair" and of many another picture,
which have earned for her the distinction of the best animal-painter of
her time.</p>

<p>Her father's family belonged to Bordeaux. Raymond Bonheur had gone up as
a youth to Paris to study art. After the usual apprenticeship to
privation which art exacts from her servants, he had become moderately
successful, when the condition of his parents, now old and poorly-off,
moved him to return to Bordeaux <span class="pagenum"><a id="page277" name="page277"></a>(p. 277)</span> and do what he could to make
their life easier. As the chances for a professional artist were small,
he adopted the modest employment of drawing-teacher. His skill soon
brought him pupils; among them a young lady from Altona, between whom
and her teacher a mutual interest sprang up which led to their marriage.
Raymond Bonheur brought his wife home to his father's house, where she
was welcomed as a daughter, and for the brief term of her life all went
well. What the husband earned by his drawing-lessons, the wife
supplemented by her lessons in music; but this happiness was not to
last. The parents of Raymond Bonheur died, and then, after not more than
twelve years of marriage, the wife died, leaving behind her four
children, Rosalie, Francois-Auguste, Jules-Isidore, and Juliette.</p>

<a id="img026" name="img026"></a>
<div class="floatright">
<img src="images/img026.jpg" width="250" height="320" alt="Rosa Bonheur." title="">
</div>

<p>Rosalie is the best known of these four children of Raymond Bonheur; but
each of them has honorably connected his name with the art of modern
France. Francois-Auguste has a reputation as an animal-painter almost
equal to that of his sister Rosa. A fine picture painted by him, "Cattle
in the Forest of Fontainebleau," was once the property of the late A. T.
Stewart. His merit secured him the Cross of the Legion of Honor in 1867.
He died in 1880. The other brother, Jules-Isidore, has gained
distinction as a sculptor of animals; most of his work is on a small
scale, but he has designed some large pieces that decorate his sister's
château near Fontainebleau. Juliette Bonheur married a M. Peyrol, and
joining her family-name to his, is known in the art-world as Mme. Peyrol
Bonheur. It is thus she signs her pictures, mostly still-life and animal
subjects, which have gained for her a good position among the minor
artists of France.</p>

<p>Rosa, the eldest of the family, born in 1822, was ten years old when her
mother died. Not long after, Raymond Bonheur decided to leave Bordeaux
and to return to Paris, where the chances for professional success were
better than in a provincial town, and where there were greater
opportunities for the education of his young children. The change proved
very distasteful, however, to the little ones. Accustomed to the
comparative freedom of the town in which they had been brought up, and
where their family had been so long rooted that their circle of friends
and relatives gave them playmates and companions in plenty, they found
themselves very lonely in Paris, where they were reduced for a good part
of the time to such amusement as they could find in the narrow quarters
of their rooms on the sixth floor of an apartment-house. It is not the
custom in Paris for the children, even of the poor, to make a
playground of the street, and our <span class="pagenum"><a id="page278" name="page278"></a>(p. 278)</span> little ones had nobody to
walk out with them but an old servant who had come with them from
Bordeaux, and who was ill-fitted, for all her virtues, to take a
mother's place to the children. She was honest and faithful, but like
all of her class, she liked routine and order, and she could make no
allowances for the restlessness of her bright-minded charge. Rosa was
her especial torment; the black sheep of the brood. Household tasks she
despised, and study, as it was pursued in the successive schools to
which her despairing father sent her, had no charms for her. Her best
playmates were animals; the horses and dogs she saw in the streets and
which she fearlessly accosted; the sheep that found itself queerly
lodged on the top floor of a city house; and the parrot which, as we
have seen, was not only her playmate but her schoolmaster.</p>

<p>There came a time when the charge of such a child, so averse to rules
and so given to strange ways of passing her time, became too much for
the old servant with her orthodox views of life, and she persuaded
Rosa's father to put her as a day-scholar with the nuns at Chaillot, a
small suburb of Paris. How it happened that she was allowed to go back
and forth alone, between home and school, we do not know; but it is not
to be wondered at if she were irregular in her hours; if, one day, she
set the nuns wondering why she did not appear at school-opening, and
another day put the old servant into a twitter because she did not come
home in season. The truth was, she had found that there was something
better in Paris than streets and shops and tall houses; she had
discovered a wood there, a veritable forest, with trees, and pools of
water, and birds, and wild flowers, and though this enchanted spot which
citizens called the Bois de Boulogne&mdash;not then a formal park as it is
to-day&mdash;was off the road to Chaillot, yet it was not so far that she
need fear getting lost in going there or in coming back. No wonder,
then, if, once this way discovered of escape from tiresome school
duties, it was travelled so often by Rosalie, and that her school-work
became in consequence so unsatisfactory that at length the patient nuns
remonstrated. They advised Rosa's father, since she neither would nor
could learn anything from books, that it would be better to put her to
some useful trade by which she might earn her living; and the good
sisters suggested&mdash;dressmaking! The wisdom of these ladies, who could
not see that they were dealing with the last woman in the world to whom
dressmaking could be interesting, was matched by that of the father, who
showed himself so blind to the character of his daughter that he
resolved to act at once upon the advice of the nuns; and without
consulting the wishes of poor Rosalie he apprenticed her straightway to
a Parisian dressmaker. The docile girl allowed the yoke to be slipped
over her head without complaint, but the confinement wore upon her
health and spirits, and after a short trial the experiment had to be
abandoned. Her father yielded to her entreaties and took her home.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img027.jpg" width="400" height="555" alt="" title="">
<p>Rosa Bonheur.</p>
</div>

<p>The girl was long in coming to a knowledge of herself. Although she was
to be, in time, a famous artist, the familiar legend of the biographers
is wanting in her case; we read nothing about scribbled books or walls
defaced by childish sketches, nor does she appear to have handled a
pencil or a brush until she was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page279" name="page279"></a>(p. 279)</span> a girl well grown. Her
father's means were not sufficient to give Rosa or his other children an
education such as he could wish; but an expedient suggested itself in
his perplexity over this latest experiment in providing for his eldest
daughter: he proposed to the principal of a young ladies' school where
he taught drawing, that his services should be accepted in payment of
Rosa's education. The offer was accepted, and in the regular course of
study Rosa became a member of her father's drawing-class. It was not
long before she surpassed all her school-fellows in that department, and
found herself for the first time in her life in possession of the key to
that happiness which consists in knowing what we can do, and feeling the
strength within us to do it. Some of the biographers of Rosa's life
speak of unhappy days at this school: the richer girls made sport of the
dress of the drawing-master's daughter, and of her independent, awkward
ways. Her progress in drawing, too, was counterbalanced by her slowness
in her other studies; in fact her new accomplishment was such a delight
to her, that in her devotion to it she became less and less interested
in her books; and as for dress&mdash;that it should be clean and suited both
to her means and to the work she was doing, was all that concerned her,
then or since!</p>

<p>At the end of her first year in school, Rosa obtained her father's
permission to give up her other studies and to enter his studio as pupil
and assistant. From that time, though as yet she had not found the
reason of her vocation, yet her true life had begun. She worked
diligently under the direction of a master she loved, and her father, in
his turn, delighted at the discovery of a talent so long hid, redoubled
his efforts to advance his pupil and to make up for lost time.</p>

<p>Rosa worked for some months at copying in the Louvre, but though she
worked with such diligence and skill as to win the praise of the
director, she came, after a time, to feel that the mere copying of the
works of other men, however great, was not the goal she was striving
after; so one day she took a sudden determination, left the Louvre,
packed up her painting materials, and started off for one of the rural
suburbs of Paris, where she sat herself down to sketch from nature. Her
love of animals, hitherto an aimless pleasure, now took on a new phase
as she saw her beloved cows and sheep in their place in nature giving
life and animation to the landscape.</p>

<p>In the winter season, when work out-of-doors was no longer pleasant or
profitable, Rosa made what use she could of the few opportunities Paris
had to offer for the study of animals. She spent what time she could
spare from work at the horse-market; she visited the slaughter-houses,
and the suburban fairs where cattle and horses, sheep and pigs compete
for prizes, and in these places she filled her portfolios with sketches.</p>

<p>In 1840 she sent her first picture to the Salon, and as it was accepted
and well received, she continued to send her work every year; but, up to
1849, her pictures were small, and had little more interest than belongs
to simple studies from nature; 1849 was a memorable year to her, as it
was to France. In this year her father died of cholera, just as he had
been appointed director of the School of Design for Young Girls. Rosa
was appointed to succeed him with the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page280" name="page280"></a>(p. 280)</span> title of Honorary
Directress, and her sister Juliette was made a teacher in the school. In
the same year she exhibited the picture that may be said to have made
her reputation with the artists and amateurs, as well as with the
general public. This was her "Oxen of Cantal," a picture that combined
with no little feeling for landscape the most admirable painting of
cattle in repose. Its high qualities were immediately recognized. Horace
Vernet, in the name of the Provisional Government, presented her with a
handsome vase of Sèvres porcelain, and the gold medal for painting. In
1851, the jury selected for exhibition at the World's Fair in London
another picture by Rosa, "Ploughing in the Nivernais," which made the
artist's name known to England, where the national love of animals
secured for her no end of praise and of substantial reward. In 1856 Rosa
painted her most popular picture, "The Horse Fair," now in the
Metropolitan Museum. This painting went from Paris to London, where it
was bought for rising £1,500, and created such an interest in the
artist's personality as would have turned the head of any ordinary
woman; but Rosa Bonheur's whole life proves her no ordinary woman.</p>

<p>For many years Mlle. Bonheur lived in Paris in a house surrounded by a
large garden where she kept a number of animals, partly for the pleasure
of their companionship, partly for the opportunity it gave her of
studying their habits, and using them as models. She now resides in the
Château By, near Fontainebleau, where she leads the same industrious
life in her advancing years that she did in the beginning of her career.
She rises early, and works at her painting all day, and often spends the
evening in drawing: for she takes but little interest in what is called
society, and cares only for the companionship of her intimate friends,
which she can enjoy without disarranging her life, or neglecting the
studies she loves. She dresses with great simplicity at all times, and
even when she accepts invitations, makes no concessions to the caprices
of fashion. In her student-days, when visiting the abattoirs, markets,
and fairs, she accustomed herself to wear such a modification of man's
dress as would permit her to move about among rough men without
compromising her sex. But, beside that her dignity was always safe in
her own keeping, she bears testimony to the good manners and the good
dispositions of the men she came in contact with. Rosa Bonheur has
always been an honor to art and an honor to her sex. At seventy-two she
finds herself in the enjoyment of many things that go to make a happy
life. She has a well-earned fame as an artist; an abundant fortune
gained by her own industry and used as honorably as it has been gained;
and she has troops of friends drawn to her by her solid worth of
character.</p>

<p>Of the great number of pictures Rosa Bonheur has painted, by far the
most are of subjects found in France, but a few of the best were painted
in Scotland. She has received many public honors in medals and
decorations. In 1856, after painting the "Horse Fair," the Empress
Eugénie visited her at her studio and bestowed upon her the Cross of the
Legion of Honor, fastening the decoration to the artist's dress with her
own hands. When the invading army of Prussia reached Paris, the Crown
Prince gave orders that the studio of Rosa Bonheur <span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name="page281"></a>(p. 281)</span> should be
respected. But though she, no doubt, holds all these honors at their
worth, yet she holds still more dear the art to which she owes, not only
these, but all that has made her life a treasury of happy remembrances.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

(BORN 1824)</h3>

<div class="floatleft">

</div>

<p>In the Paris Salon of 1847, a small picture appeared, representing a
Greek boy and girl stirring up two game-cocks to fight. Although it was
the work of an unknown painter, and had to contend with an unusually
brilliant display of pictures, many of them by men already famous, yet
it strongly attracted the general public, partly by the novelty of the
subject, and partly by the careful and finished manner of the painting.
It delighted the critics as well, and one of the most distinguished of
them, Théophile Gautier, wrote: "A new Greek is born to us, and his name
is Gérôme!"</p>

<p>This picture, which was to prove the first leaf in a laurel-crown to be
awarded the painter in his lifetime, and not, as is so often the case,
by the tardy hand of Death, was the work of Jean-Léon Gérôme, a young
man of twenty-three. He had been for six years under the teaching of
Paul Delaroche, part of the time in Italy, but most of it in Paris. He
was born at Vesoul, a small, dull town in the Department of Haute-Saône,
in 1824. His father was a goldsmith, who, like most French fathers in
his rank of life, had hoped to bring up his son to succeed him in his
business. The boy did for a time, we believe, work in his father's shop,
but he had a stronger natural bent for painting; something perhaps in
the occupation fostered, or even created, this taste&mdash;for not a few
distinguished painters have been apprenticed to the goldsmith's
trade&mdash;and his father, like a wise man, instead of opposing his son's
wishes, did what he could to further them. He bought him
painting-materials; and instead of sending him to a "school of design,"
or putting him under the tutelage of some third-rate drawing-master,
such as is commonly found in country towns, he bought him a picture by
Decamps, an artist since become famous, but then just in the dawn of his
fame, and put it before his son as a model. Young Gérôme made a copy of
this picture, and an artist from Paris, who happened to be passing
through Vesoul, saw <span class="pagenum"><a id="page282" name="page282"></a>(p. 282)</span> it, and discerning the boy's talent, gave
him a letter to Paul Delaroche, encouraging him to go to Paris and there
to take up the study of art as a profession. At seventeen years of age,
with his father's consent and $250 in his pocket, Gérôme went up to
Paris, and presenting his letter to Delaroche, was well received by him,
and entered the School of Fine Arts (École des Beaux-Arts) as his pupil.</p>

<p>He had been with Delaroche three years and had proved himself one of the
most loyal and diligent of his pupils, when an event occurred,
insignificant in itself, but which was to have an important influence
upon his life and give a new direction to his talent.</p>

<p>French studios are not as a rule very orderly places. The young men who
frequent them are left pretty much to themselves, with no one to govern
them or to oversee them. The artist they are studying under makes, at
the most, a brief daily visit, going the round of the easels, saying a
word or two to each pupil, although it often happens that he says
nothing, and then departs for his proper work, leaving his pupils to
their own devices. The students are for the most part like young men
everywhere, a turbulent set, full of animal spirits, which sometimes
carry them beyond reasonable bounds. It was a boisterous outbreak of
this sort, but far wilder than common, that occurred in the studio of
Delaroche, and which brought about the crisis in Gérôme's life to which
we have alluded. Fortunately for him, the incident took place while
Gérôme was on a visit to his parents at Vesoul, so that he was in no way
implicated in the affair. He came back to find the studio closed;
Delaroche, deeply disturbed, had dismissed all his pupils and announced
his intention to visit Italy. His studio was to be taken during his
absence, by Gleyre, and he advised those of his pupils in whom he took a
personal interest, to continue their studies under his successor. Gérôme
was one of those to whom he gave this advice, but Gérôme was too much
attached to his master to leave him for another, and bluntly announced
his purpose of following him to Rome. A few of the other pupils of
Delaroche were of the same mind, and they all set out for Italy
together. Arrived in Rome, Gérôme, always a hard worker, threw himself
energetically into his studies; drawing the ancient buildings, the
Capitol, the Colosseum; sketching in the Forum and on the Campagna;
copying the pictures and the statues, saturating his mind in the spirit
of antique art, and schooling his hand in its forms, until he had laid
up a rich store of material for use in future pictures. On his return to
Paris he worked for a while in Gleyre's studio, but when Delaroche came
back from Italy, Gérôme again joined him and renewed his old relation as
pupil and assistant&mdash;working, among other tasks, on the painting of
"Charlemagne Crossing the Alps," a commission given to Delaroche by the
Government, for the <i>Grande Galerie des Batailles</i> at Versailles: a vast
apartment lined with pictures of all the victories of the French from
Soissons to Solferino.</p>

<p>Such work as this, however, had little interest for Gérôme. His mind at
this time was full of the Greeks and Romans; his enthusiasm for
Napoleon, which later was to give birth to so many pictures, had not
yet awakened; nor did he <span class="pagenum"><a id="page283" name="page283"></a>(p. 283)</span> care for the subjects from the
histories of France and England in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, that had provided his master, Delaroche, with so many tragic
themes for his pencil: "The Death of the Duke of Guise," "The Children
of Edward," the "Death of Queen Elizabeth," "The Execution of Lady Jane
Grey," "Cromwell at the Coffin of Charles I.," and others of the same
strain.</p>

<p>Gérôme's visit to Italy had awakened in him a strong interest in the
life of the antique world, and this would naturally be strengthened by
all that he would hear and see of the growing interest of the public in
the same subject: an interest kindled by the discoveries of
archaeologists in classic soil: in Greece and Italy, in Assyria and
Egypt. These discoveries had filled the museums and the cabinets of
private collectors with beautiful and interesting fragments illustrating
the external life of the past, and illuminating its poetry; and it is no
wonder that some of the younger artists rejoiced in the new world of
anecdote and story that opened so richly before them.</p>

<p>However it came about&mdash;whether his own interest in the antique life
communicated itself to his fellows, or whether they, all together,
simply shared in the interest taken in the subject by the world about
them&mdash;Gérôme and some of his companions in Delaroche's studio showed
such a predilection for classic themes, that they were nicknamed by the
critics "The New Greeks." Among Gérôme's fellow-pupils were two young
men, Hamon and Aubert, who later gained no small applause by their
playful and familiar way of treating classic themes. They are well known
to us by engravings from their pictures, which are in all our shops.
Hamon's "My Sister is not at home," and Aubert's various pretty fancies
of nymphs and cupids, while they are not great works of art, are
reasonably sure of a long life, due to their innocent freshness and
simplicity.</p>

<p>Delaroche's pupils were working all together in friendly competition for
the grand Roman prize which was to give the fortunate one the right to
four years' study in Rome at the expense of the state. Gérôme's studio
was shared by his friends Picou and Hamon. Hamon, writing in later years
about his youthful days, says: "Companions and rivals at the same time,
we were all working together for the Grand Prix de Rome. Gérôme inspired
us all with the love of hard work, and of hard work to the accompaniment
of singing and laughing."</p>

<p>But in the intervals of his hard work for the prize, Gérôme was also
working on a picture which he hoped to have accepted for the Salon. This
was the picture we spoke of in the beginning of this notice: "Two Young
Greeks stirring-up Game-cocks to fight." When it was finished Gérôme
showed it to his master with many misgivings; but Delaroche encouraged
him to send it to the Salon. It was accepted, and as we have seen, won
for Gérôme a great success with the public. The next year, 1848, he
again exhibited, but the impression he made was less marked than on the
first occasion. His former picture had a subject such as it was, of his
own devising. The "Cock-fight" was not an illustration of any passage in
Greek poetry, and in spite of its antique setting, it had a modern air,
and to this, no doubt, its popularity was largely due. But in 1848 he
essayed an illustration of the Greek poet, Anacreon, translating into
picture the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page284" name="page284"></a>(p. 284)</span> poem that tells how, one winter evening, sitting by
his fire, the old poet was surprised by a sound of weeping outside his
door, and opening it, found Cupid wet and shivering and begging for a
shelter from the cold. The man takes the pretty, dimpled mischief to his
bosom, warms his feet and hands at the fire, dries his bow and arrows,
and lets him sip wine from his cup. Then, when Cupid is refreshed and
warmed, he tries his arrows, now here, now there, and at last aims one
straight at his benefactor's heart, and laughing at the jest, flies out
at the open door. Gérôme's picture was in three panels. The first showed
the poet opening the door to the sobbing Cupid, with his bedraggled
wings and dripping curls; in the next, the rosy ingrate wounds his
benefactor; in the third, the poet sits disconsolate by his hearth,
musing over the days when Love was his guest, if but for an hour. As the
story was an old one, so many an artist before Gérôme had played with it
as a subject for a picture. Jean-François Millet himself, another pupil
of Delaroche, though earlier than Gérôme, had tried his hand at
illustrating Anacreon's fable before he found his proper field of work
in portraying the occupations of the men and women about him, the
peasants among whom he was born and bred.</p>

<p>Gérôme's picture did nothing to advance his fortunes with the public.
1848 was a stormy time in France and in all Europe, and people were not
in the mood to be amused with such trifles as Anacreon and his Cupid.
The pictures in that year's Salon that drew the public in crowds about
them were Couture's "The Romans of the Decline of the Empire," in which
all Paris saw, or thought it saw, the handwriting-on-the-wall for the
government of Louis-Philippe; and the "Shipwrecked Sailors in a Bark,"
of Delacroix, a wild and stormy scene of terror that seemed to echo the
prophecies of evil days at hand for France with which the time was rife.</p>

<p>Gérôme's next picture, however, was to bring him once more before the
public, and to carry his name beyond his native France even as far as
America. Leaving for the nonce his chosen field of antiquity, where yet
he was to distinguish himself, he looked for a subject in the Paris of
his own day. "The Duel after the Masquerade" opens for us a corner of
the Bois de Boulogne&mdash;the fashionable park on the outskirts of
Paris&mdash;where in the still dawn of a winter's day, a group of men are met
to witness a duel between two of their companions who have quarrelled at
a masked ball. The ground is covered with a light fall of snow; the bare
branches of the trees weave their network across the gray sky, and in
the distance we see the carriages that have brought the disputants to
the field. The duel is over. One of the men, dressed in the costume of
Pierrot, the loose white trousers and slippers, the baggy white shirt,
and white skull-cap, falls, mortally wounded, into the arms of his
second: the pallor of coming death masked by the white-painted face. The
other combatant, a Mohawk Indian (once a staple character at every
masked-ball in Paris: curious survival of the popularity of Cooper's
novels), is led wounded off the field by a friend dressed as Harlequin.
Gérôme in this striking picture showed for the first time that talent
as a story-teller to which he is so largely indebted for his
reputation. Whatever <span class="pagenum"><a id="page285" name="page285"></a>(p. 285)</span> his subject may be, it is always set forth
in the clearest manner, so that everyone may understand the story
without the need of an interpreter.</p>

<p>Leaving out of view the few pictures he painted illustrating passages in
Napoleon's career, it may be said that Gérôme's taste led him away from
scenes of modern life; for even his many oriental subjects so relate to
forms of life belonging in reality to the past, that they make no
exception to the statement. He did not therefore follow up "The Duel"
with other comments on the follies of modern society&mdash;for in the temper
of that time this picture, like Couture's "Roman Orgie" and Millet's
"Man with the Hoe," was looked upon as a satire and a warning, and owed
its popularity as much to this conviction on the part of the public as
to its pictorial merits&mdash;but returned to antique times, and showed in
his treatment of themes from that source an equal, if not a greater
power to interest the public.</p>

<p>Gérôme's two pictures, the "Ave Cæsar! Morituri te Salutant," "Hail,
Cæsar! Those about to die, salute Thee," and "The Gladiators," are so
universally known as to need no description. Whatever criticism may be
made upon them, they will always remain interesting to the world at
large; from their subject, from the way in which the discoveries of
archæology are made familiar, and, not least, from the impression they
make of the artist's own strong interest in what he had to say. In both
pictures he succeeded in showing the Colosseum as no longer a ruin, but
as, so to speak, a living place peopled by the swarm of the Roman
populace, with the emperor and his court, and the College of the Vestal
Virgins, and, for chief actors, the hapless wretches who are "butchered
to make a Roman holiday." Another picture that greatly increased
Gérôme's reputation, was his "Death of Julius Cæsar," though it must be
confessed there was a touch of the stage in the arrangement of the
scene, and in the action of the body of senators and conspirators
leaving the hall with brandished swords and as if singing in chorus,
that was absent from the pictures of the amphitheatre. There was also
less material for the curiosity of the lovers of archæology; no such
striking point, for instance, as the reproduction of the gladiators'
helmets and armor recently discovered in Herculaneum; but the body of
the dead Cæsar lying "even at the base of Pompey's statue" with his face
muffled in his toga, was a masterly performance; some critic, moved by
the grandeur of the lines, said it was not a mere piece of
foreshortening, it was "a perspective." Gérôme made a life-size painting
of the Cæsar in this picture. It is in the Corcoran Gallery at
Washington.</p>

<p>Gérôme painted several other pictures from classic subjects, but none of
them had the interest for the general public of those we have described.
In 1854 he exhibited a huge canvas, called "The Age of Augustus," a
picture suggested, perhaps, by the "Hemicycle" of his master Delaroche,
on which he himself had painted. It represented heroes, poets, sages, of
the Augustan age, grouped about the cradle of the infant Christ; it
procured for Gérôme the red ribbon of the Legion of Honor, and is now,
as the artist himself jestingly says, "the 'greatest' picture in the
Museum of Amiens." In the same year Gérôme went <span class="pagenum"><a id="page286" name="page286"></a>(p. 286)</span> to Egypt for
the first time; since then he has more than once visited it, but it is
doubtful if he could renew the pleasure of his youthful experience. "I
set out," he says, "with my friends, I the fifth, all of us lightly
furnished with money, but full of youthful enthusiasm. Life was then
easy in Egypt; we lived at a very moderate rate; we hired a boat and
lived four months upon the Nile, hunting, painting, fishing by turns,
from Damietta to Philæ. We returned to Cairo and remained there four
months longer in a house in the older part of the town, belonging to
Soleman Pasha. As Frenchmen, he treated us with cordial hospitality.
Happy period of youth, of freedom from care! Hope and the future opened
bright before us; the sky was blue!"</p>

<p>Gérôme's pictures of Eastern life make a gallery by themselves. A few of
them are historic, such as his "Cleopatra visiting Cæsar," but the most
of them are simply scenes and incidents drawn from the daily life of the
modern inhabitants of Cairo and the desert, illustrating their manners
and customs. The mere titles would fill up a large part of our space.
Many of the best of them are owned in this country, and all have been
reproduced by engraving or by photography.</p>

<p>In another field Gérôme won great distinction, painting scenes from the
history of France in the reign of Louis XIV.; subjects drawn from what
may be called the high comedy of court-life, and treated by Gérôme with
remarkable refinement and distinction. Among these pictures the best
known are: "Molière Breakfasting with Louis XIV.," illustrating the
story of the king's rebuke to his courtiers who affected to despise the
man of genius; "Père Joseph," the priest who under the guise of humility
and self-abnegation reduces the greatest nobles to the state of lackeys;
"Louis XIV. Receiving the Great Condé," and "Collaboration," two poets
of Louis XIV.'s time working together over a play. Among his
accomplishments as an artist we must not forget the talent that Gérôme
has shown as a sculptor. He has modelled several figures from his own
pictures, with such admirable skill as to prove that he might easily
have made sculpture a profession had he not chosen to devote himself to
painting.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<p>Those whose privilege it was to meet the late Mr. Gabriel Rossetti, at
once in the plenitude of his powers and in the freshness of their own
impressions, will not expect to be moved again through life by so
magnetic a presence. In his dealings with those much younger than
himself, his tact and influence were unequalled; he received a shy but
ardent youth with such a noble courtesy, with so much sympathy yet with
no condescension, with so grand an air and yet so warm a welcome, that
his new acquaintance was enslaved at the first sentence. This seems to
me to have been in a certain sense the key-note of the man. He was
essentially a point of fire; not a peripatetic in any sense, not a
person of wide circumference, but a nucleus of pure imagination that
never stirred or shifted, but scintillated in all directions. The
function of Gabriel Rossetti, or at least his most obvious function, was
to sit in isolation, and to have vaguely glimmering spirits presented to
him for complete illumination. He was the most prompt in suggestion, the
most regal in giving, the most sympathetic in response, of the men I
have known or seen; and this without a single touch of the prophetic
manner, the air of such professional seers as Coleridge or Carlyle. What
he had to give was not mystical or abstract; it was purely concrete. His
mind was full of practical artistic schemes, only a few of which were
suited to his own practice in painting or poetry; the rest were at the
service of whoever would come in a friendly spirit and take them. I find
among his letters to me, which I have just been reading once again, a
paper of delightful suggestions about the cover of a book of verse; the
next youth who waited upon him would perhaps be a painter, and would
find that the great genius and master did not disdain the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page288" name="page288"></a>(p. 288)</span>
discussion of picture-frames. This was but the undercurrent of his
influence; as we shall see more and more every year as the central
decades of this century become history, its main stream directed the two
great arts of painting and poetry into new channels, and set a score of
diverse talents in motion.</p>

<p>But, as far as anything can be seen plainly about Rossetti at present,
to me the fact of his immovability, his self-support, his curious
reserve, seems to be the most interesting. He held in all things to the
essential and not to the accidental; he preferred the dry grain of musk
to a diluted flood of perfume. An Italian by birth and deeply moved by
all things Italian, he never visited Italy; a lover of ritual and a
sympathizer with all the mysteries of the Roman creed, he never joined
the Catholic Church; a poet whose form and substance alike influenced
almost all the men of his generation, he was more than forty years of
age before he gave his verse to the public; a painter who considered the
attitude of the past with more ardor and faith than almost any artist of
his time, he never chose to visit the churches or galleries of Europe.
It has been said, among the many absurd things which his death has
provoked, that he shrank from publicity from timidity, or spurned it
from ill-temper. One brilliant journalist has described him as sulking
like Hector in his tent. It used to be Achilles who sulked when I was at
school; but it certainly never was Gabriel Rossetti. Those who only knew
him, after his constitution had passed under the yoke of the drug which
killed him, cannot judge of his natural reserve from that artificial and
morbid reserve which embittered the last years of his life. The former
was not connected with any objection to new faces or dislike of cordial
society, but with the indomitable characteristic of the man, which made
him give out the treasures of the spirit, and never need to receive
them. So far from disliking society, it is my impression that he craved
it as a necessity, although he chose to select its constituents and
narrow its range.</p>

<p>He was born in 1828. The story of his parentage is well known, and has
been told in full detail since his death. He was born in London and
christened Gabriel Charles Rossetti; it was not, I am told, until he was
of age to appreciate the value of the name that he took upon himself the
cognomen which his father had borne, the Dante by which the world,
though not his friends, have known him. Living with his father in
Charlotte street, with two sisters and a brother no less ardently
trained in letters than himself, he seems to have been turned to poetry,
as he was afterward sustained in it, by the interior flame. The
household has been described to me by one who saw it in 1847: the
father, titular professor of Italian literature, but with no
professional duties, seated the livelong day, with a shade over his
eyes, writing devotional or patriotic poetry in his native tongue; the
girls reading Dante aloud with their rich maiden voices; Gabriel buried
here in his writing, or darting round the corner of the street to the
studio where he painted. From this seclusion he wrote to the friend who
has kindly helped me in preparing these notes, and whose memories of the
poet extend over a longer period than those of any survivor not related
to him.</p>

<p>Mr. W. B. Scott, now so well known in more arts than one, had then but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page289" name="page289"></a>(p. 289)</span> just published his first book, his mystical and transcendental
poem of "The Year of the World." This seems to have fallen under
Rossetti's notice, for on November 25, 1847, he wrote to the author, a
perfect stranger to himself, a letter of warm sympathy and
acknowledgment. Mr. Scott was living in Newcastle, and, instead of
meeting, the young poets at first made acquaintance with each other by
correspondence. Rossetti soon mentioned, of course, his own schemes and
ambitions, and he sent, as a sample of his powers, his poems of "The
Blessed Damozel," and "My Sister's Sleep," which he had written about
eighteen months before.</p>

<p>Mr. Scott tells me that his first feeling on receiving these poems,
written in English by an Italian boy of eighteen, was one of amazement.
I cannot wonder at it. If the "Blessed Damozel," when it was published a
quarter of a century later, seemed a masterpiece to those who had, in
the meanwhile, read so much that was vaguely inspired by it, what must
it have been in 1846? Certain pieces in Tennyson's "Poems," of 1842, and
a few fragments of Browning's "Bells and Pomegranates" were the only
English poems which can be supposed to have given it birth, even
indirectly. In its interpretation of mystical thoughts by concrete
images, in its mediæval fervor and consistence of fancy, in its peculiar
metrical facility, it was distinctly new&mdash;original as few poems except
those by the acknowledged masters of the craft can ever be.</p>

<p class="poem30">
<span class="min03em">"</span>The sun was gone now; the curled moon<br>
<span class="add1em">Was like a little feather</span><br>
  Fluttering far down the gulf; and now<br>
<span class="add1em">She spoke through the clear weather.</span><br>
  Her voice was like the voice the stars<br>
<span class="add1em">Had when they sang together."</span></p>

<p>This was a strange accent in 1846. Miss Barrett and Mr. Tennyson were
then the most accepted poets. Mr. Browning spoke fluently and
persistently, but only to a very little circle; Mr. Horne's "Orion" and
Mr. Bailey's "Festus" were the recent outcomes of Keats and Goethe; the
Spasmodic School, to be presently born of much unwise study of "Festus,"
was still unknown; Mr. Clough, Mr. Matthew Arnold, and Mr. Patmore were
quite unapparent, taking form and voice in solitude; and here was a new
singer, utterly unlike them all, pouring out his first notes with the
precision and independence of the new-fledged thrush in the woodland
chorus.</p>

<p>In painting, the process was somewhat different. In this art, no less
than in poetry, Rossetti understood at once what it was that he wished
to do himself, and what he desired to see others doing; but the
difficulties of technique were in his way. He had begun to write in
childhood, but he had taken up design late in his youth, and he had
undergone no discipline in it. At the present day, when every student
has to pass a somewhat stringent examination in design, Rossetti, at
eighteen, could not have entered the schools of the Royal Academy. He
did so, however, yet without ever advancing to the Life School. The soul
of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page290" name="page290"></a>(p. 290)</span> art, at this early period, interested him far more than the
body, especially such a substance as he found under the presidency of
Sir Martin Shee and the keepership of George Jones. Let us not forget,
meanwhile, that it is easy to sneer at the incompetence of mannered old
artists, and yet hard to over-estimate the value of discipline in a
school, however conventional. Rossetti was too impatient to learn to
draw, and this he lived to regret. His immediate associates, the young
men whom he began to lead and impress, were better draughtsmen than he.
His first oil picture, I believe, was a portrait of his father, now in
possession of the family. But, as far as can be now made out, he did not
begin to paint seriously till about January, 1848, when he persuaded
another Royal Academy student, W. Holman Hunt, to take a large room
close to the paternal house in Charlotte street, and make it their
studio. Here Mr. Scott visited them in the early spring of that year; he
describes to me the large pictures they were struggling upon, Hunt, on
his "Oath of Rienzi," and Rossetti, on his "Girlhood of Mary Virgin."
The latter was evidently at present but poorly equipped; the painting
was timid and boyish, pale in tone, and with no hint or promise of that
radiant color which afterward became Rossetti's main characteristic. But
the feeling was identical with that in his far more accomplished early
poems. The very pulse and throb of mediæval adoration pervaded the whole
conception of the picture, and Mr. Scott's first impression was that, in
this marvellous poet and possible painter, the new Tractarian movement
had found its expositor in art. Yet this surely was no such feeble or
sentimental echo as had inspired the declared Tractarian poets of eight
or nine years earlier; there was nothing here that recalled such a book
as the "Cherwell Water Lily" of Father Faber. This contained the genuine
fleshly mysticism, bodily presentment of a spiritual idea, and intimate
knowledge of mediæval sentiment without which the new religious fervor
had no intellectual basis. This strong instinct for the forms of the
Catholic religion, combined with no attendance on the rites of that
church, fostered by no study of ecclesiastical literature or association
with teachers or proselytes, but original to himself and self-supported,
was at that time without doubt the feature in Rossetti's intellectual
character which demands our closest attention. Nor do I believe that
this passion for the physical presentation of a mystical idea was ever
entirely supplanted by those other views of life and art which came to
occupy his maturer mind. In his latest poems&mdash;in "Rose Mary," for
instance&mdash;I see this first impulse returning upon him with more than its
early fascination. In his youth, however, the mysticism was very naïve
and straightforward. It was fostered by one of the very few excursions
which Rossetti ever took&mdash;a tour in Belgium in October, 1849. I am told
that he and the painter-friend who accompanied him were so purely
devoted to the mediæval aspect of all they saw, that, in walking through
the galleries, they turned away their heads in approaching modern
pictures, and carefully closed their eyes while they were passing
Rubens's "Descent from the Cross." In Belgium, or as the result of his
tour there, Rossetti wrote several curious poems, which were so harsh
and forced that he omitted them from his collection when he first
published his "Poems," in 1870.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page291" name="page291"></a>(p. 291)</span> The effort in these early pieces is too marked. I remember once
hearing Rossetti say that he did not mind what people called him, if
only they would not call him "quaint." But the fact was that, if
quaintness be defined as the inability to conceal the labor of an art,
there is no doubt that both his poems and his designs occasionally
deserved this epithet. He was so excessively sincere an artist, so
determined not to permit anything like trickiness of effect or
meaningless smoothness to conceal the direct statement of an idea, that
his lack of initial discipline sometimes made itself felt in a curious
angular hardness.</p>

<p>And now it would be necessary, if I were attempting a complete study of
Gabriel Rossetti's intellectual career, to diverge into a description of
what has so much exercised popular curiosity, the pre-Raphaelite
movement of 1848. But there is no reason why, in a few notes on
character, I should repeat from hearsay what several of the seven
brothers have reported from authoritative memory. It is admitted, by
them and by all who have understood the movement, that Gabriel Rossetti
was the founder and, in the Shakespearian sense, "begetter" of all that
was done by this earnest band of young artists. One of them, Mr.
Millais, was already distinguished; two others, Mr. Holman Hunt and Mr.
Woolner, had at that time more training and technical power than he; but
he was, nevertheless, the brain and soul of the enterprise. What these
young men proposed was excellently propounded in the sonnet by "W. M.
R.," which they prefixed to their little literary venture, the "Germ,"
in 1850. Plainly to think even a little thought, to express it in
natural words which are native to the speaker, to paint even an
insignificant object as it is, and not as the old masters or the new
masters have said it should be painted, to persevere in looking at truth
and at nature without the smallest prejudice for tradition, this was the
whole mystery and cabal of the P. R. B. They called themselves
"preraphaelite," because they found in the wings of Lippi's angels, and
the columbines of Perugino's gardens that loving and exact study of
minute things which gave to them a sense of sincerity, and which they
missed in the breadth and ease of later work. They had no ambition to
"splash as no one splashed before since great Caldasi Polidore;" but
they did wish to draw a flower or a cloud so that it should be a
portrait of that cloud or flower. In this ambition it would be curious
to know, and I do not think that I have ever heard it stated, how far
they were influenced by Mr. Ruskin and his "Modern Painters." I should
not expect to find Rossetti influenced by any outside force in this any
more than in other instances, but at all events Mr. Ruskin eagerly
accepted the brotherhood as practical exponents of the theories he had
pronounced. None of them, I think, knew him personally when he wrote the
famous letter to the <i>Times</i> in 1851, defending Mr. Millais and Mr.
Holman Hunt from the abuse of ignorant critics, who, he said, had failed
to perceive the very principles on which these "two young men" were
proceeding. Somebody wrote to him to explain that there were "three
young men," and Mr. Ruskin wrote a note to Gabriel Rossetti, desiring to
see his work, and thus the acquaintance of these two remarkable men
commenced.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, although the more vigorous members of the brotherhood had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page292" name="page292"></a>(p. 292)</span> shown no special sympathy for Rossetti's religious mysticism, a
feebler artist, himself one of the original seven, had taken it up with
embarrassing effusion. This was the late James Collinson, whose
principal picture, "St. Elizabeth of Hungary," finished in 1851,
produced a sort of crisis in Rossetti's career. This painting
out-mystified the mystic himself; it was simply maudlin and hysterical,
though drawn with some feeling for grace, and in a very earnest spirit.
Rossetti, with his strong good sense, recognized that it would be
impossible ever to reach the public with art of this unmanly character,
and from this time forth he began to abandon the practice of directly
sacred art.</p>

<p>For some little time after abandoning the directly sacred field in
painting, Rossetti seems to have passed through a disconsolate and
dubious period. I am told that he worked for many months over a large
picture called "Kate the Queen," from some well-known words by Browning.
He made no progress with this, seemed dissatisfied with his own media,
felt the weight of his lack of training, and passed, in short, through
one of those downcast moods, which Shakespeare has so marvellously
described in "Tired with all these," and which are incident, sooner or
later, to every man of genius. While his touch in poetry grew constantly
more sure and masterly, his power as a draughtsman threatened to leave
him altogether. He was to have drawn one of the frontispieces in the
"Germ," but, although he toiled with a design, he could not make it
"come right." At last a happy accident put him on the true track, and
revealed his proper genius to himself. He began to make small drawings
of poetical subjects in water-colors&mdash;most of those which I have seen
are not more than twenty inches by twelve&mdash;over which he labored, and
into which he poured his exquisite sense of color, inspired without
doubt by the glass of mediæval church windows. He travelled so very
little, that I do not know whether he ever saw the treasures of radiant
jewel-work which fret the gloom of Chartres or of Bourges; but if he
never saw them, he divined them, and these are the only pieces of color
which in the least degree suggest the drawings of this, Rossetti's
second period. As far as one can gather, his method was, first, to
become interpenetrated with the sentiment of some ballad or passage of
emotional poetry, then to meditate on the scene till he saw it clearly
before him; then&mdash;and this seems to have always been the difficult and
tedious part&mdash;to draw in the design, and then with triumphant ease to
fill in the outlines with radiant color. He had an almost insuperable
difficulty in keeping his composition within the confines of the paper
upon which he worked, and at last was content to have a purely
accidental limit to the design, no matter what limbs of the <i>dramatis
personæ</i> were sheered away by the frame. It would not be the act of a
true friend to Rossetti's memory to pretend that these drawings, of
which for the next ten or fifteen years he continued to produce a great
number, were without faults of a nature which any coxcomb could
perceive, or without eccentricities which an untrained eye might easily
mistake for faults; but this does not in the least militate against the
fact that in two great departments of the painter's faculty, in
imaginative sentiment and in wealth of color, they have never been
surpassed. They have rarely, indeed, been equalled <span class="pagenum"><a id="page293" name="page293"></a>(p. 293)</span> in the
history of painting. A Rossetti drawing of this class hung with
specimens of other art, ancient or modern, simply destroys them. I do
not mean that it is better or worse than they are, but that it kills
them as the electric light puts out a glow-worm. No other man's color
will bear these points of ruby-crimson, these expanses of deep
turquoise-blue, these flagrant scarlets and thunderous purples. He
paints the sleeve of a trumpeter; it is such an orange as the eye can
scarce endure to look at. He paints the tiles of a chimney-corner; they
are as green as the peacock's eyes in the sunshine.</p>

<p>The world is seldom ready to receive any new thing. These drawings of
Rossetti's were scarcely noticed even by those who are habitually on the
watch for fresh developments in art. But when the painter next emerges
into something like publicity we find him attended by a brilliant
company of younger men, all more or less influenced by his teaching and
attracted by his gifts. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood had been a very
ephemeral institution; in three years, or four at the most, it had
ceased to exist; but its principles and the energy of its founder had
left their mark on the whole world of art. In 1849 Rossetti had
exhibited his picture, "The Girlhood of Mary Virgin," at the Portland
Gallery, an exhibition in rivalry of the Royal Academy, which existed
but a very short time. As far as I can discover, he did not exhibit
again in London until 1856, when he and his friends opened a collection
of their pictures at 4 Russell Place, Fitzroy Square. We would rather
have seen that little gallery than see most of the show-exhibitions of
Europe. In it the fine art of the Anglo-Saxon race was seen dawning
again after its long and dark night. Rossetti himself was the principal
exhibitor, but his two earliest colleagues, now famous painters, Mr.
Millais and Mr. Holman Hunt, also contributed. And here were all the new
talents whom Rossetti had attracted around him during the last seven
years: Mr. Madox Brown, with his fine genius for history; Mr. J. D.
Watson, with his strong mediæval affinities; Mr. Boyce, with his
delicate portraiture of rustic scenes; Mr. Brett, the finest of our
students of the sea; Mr. W. B. Scott himself; besides one or two others,
Mr. Charles Collins, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Halliday, Mr. Martineau, whom
death or adverse fortune removed before they had quite fulfilled their
promise. Gabriel Rossetti contributed to this interesting and historic
exhibition five or six of those marvellous drawings of which mention has
just been made. "Dante's Dream," the famous vision of June 9, 1290, with
its counterpart, "The Anniversary of the Dream," in 1291, were the most
prominent of these. A "Mary Magdalene" was perhaps the most moving and
exciting. This extremely original design showed the Magdalene pursued by
her lovers, but turning away from them all to seek Jesus in the house of
Simon the Pharisee. The architecture in this drawing was almost
childish; the wall of Simon's house is not three inches thick, and there
is not room for a grown-up person on the stairs that lead to it; but the
tender imagination of the whole, the sweet persuasiveness of Christ, who
looks out of a window, the passion of the awakened sinner, who tears the
roses out of her hair, the curious novelty of treatment in the heads
and draperies, all these combine to make it one of those <span class="pagenum"><a id="page294" name="page294"></a>(p. 294)</span> works,
the moral force and directness of which appeal to the heart at once.
Perhaps the most brilliant piece of color at the Russell Place Gallery
may have been Rossetti's "Blue Closet," a picture which either
illustrated or, as I should rather suppose, suggested Mr. Morris's
wonderful poem published two years later.</p>

<p>The same year that displayed him to the public already surrounded by a
brilliant phalanx of painter-friends, discovered him also, to the
judicious, as a centre of poetic light and heat. The circumstances
connected with Rossetti's visit to Oxford a little earlier than this are
too recent, are fresh in the memories of too many living persons of
distinction, to be discussed with propriety by one who was not present.
But certain facts are public, and may be mentioned. The Oxford Union
still shows around the interior of its cupola strange, shadowy frescoes,
melting into nothingness, which are the work of six men, of whom
Rossetti was the leader. These youths had enjoyed no practical training
in that particularly artificial branch of art, mural painting, and yet
it seems strange that Rossetti himself, at least, should not have
understood that a vehicle, such as yolk of egg mixed with vinegar, was
absolutely necessary to tempera, or that it was proper, in
fresco-painting, to prepare the walls, and paint in the fresh wet
mortar. They used no vehicle, they fixed their colors in no coat of
plaster, but they threw their ineffectual dry paint on the naked brick.
The result has been that their interesting boyish efforts are now
decayed beyond any chance of restoration. It is impossible, however, to
ascend the gallery of the Oxford Union and examine the ghostly frescoes
that are fading there, without great interest and even emotion. Of the
young men who painted there under Gabriel Rossetti's eye, all have
become greatly distinguished. Mr. Edward Burne-Jones, Mr. William
Morris, and Mr. Spencer Stanhope were undergraduates at Oxford. Mr.
Valentine Prinsep and Mr. Arthur Hughes, I believe, were Royal Academy
students who were invited down by Rossetti. Their work was naïve and
queer to the last degree. It is perhaps not fair to say which one of
them found so much difficulty in painting the legs of his figures that
he drew an impenetrable covert of sunflowers right across his picture,
and only showed the faces of his heroes and heroines between the golden
disks.</p>

<p>The <i>Oxford and Cambridge Magazine</i>, which also dates from the year
1856, is a still more notable expression of budding genius than the dome
of the Oxford Union. It was edited by Mr. Godfrey Lushington, all its
articles were anonymous, and it contrived to exist through twelve
consecutive monthly numbers. A complete set is now rare, and the
periodical itself is much less known than befits such a receptacle of
pure literature. It contains three or four of Rossetti's finest poems; a
great many of those extraordinary pieces, steeped in mediæval coloring,
which Mr. William Morris was to collect in 1858 into his bewitching
volume, called "The Defence of Guenevere;" several delightful prose
stories of life in the Middle Ages, also by Mr. Morris, which, like
certain prose romances by Mr. Burne-Jones, have never been publicly
claimed or reprinted by their author; and not a little else that was as
new as it was notable. A little later Mr. William Morris's first book
was dedicated "To my Friend Dante Gabriel <span class="pagenum"><a id="page295" name="page295"></a>(p. 295)</span> Rossetti, Painter,"
and in 1860 Mr. Swinburne followed with a like inscription of his
first-fruits, his tragic drama of "The Queen-Mother." Thus in the course
of a little more than ten years, Rossetti had become the centre and sun
of a galaxy of talent in poetry and painting, more brilliant perhaps
than any which has ever acknowledged the beneficent sway of any one
Englishman of genius.</p>

<p>But all this while the world outside knew nothing of the matter. One by
one the younger men stepped forward on the public stage and secured the
plaudits of the discerning, and ascended the slow incline of general
reputation. But Rossetti remained obstinately recluse, far preferring to
be the priest and confessor of genius to acting himself a public part.
To this determination several outward things engaged him still further.
He married quite early in life; and his wife, who was herself an artist
of rare, if somewhat wild and untrained talent, bore him a son who died
at birth, and then shortly after died herself. During his brief married
months Rossetti had collected the MSS. of his poems, and thought to
publish them; but when he lost his wife, in a paroxysm of grief he
placed the sheets of his poems in her coffin, and would hear no more a
suggestion of publication. In 1861 he presented the world with a very
learned and beautiful anthology of early Italian poetry, and proposed as
early as that year to print his original poems. It was his scheme to
name the little volume "Dante in Verona, and other Poems;" but it came
to nothing. About 1867 the scheme of publication again took possession
of him. I have been told that a sudden sentiment of middle age, the fact
that he found himself in his fortieth year, led him to conquer his
scruples, and finally arrange his pieces. But he was singularly
fastidious; the arrangement would never please him; the cover must be
cut in brass, the paper at the sides must bear a special design. These
niceties were rarer twelve years ago than they are now, and the printers
fatigued him with their persistent obstinacy. It was not till early in
1870 that the "Poems" in stately form first appeared, and were hailed
with a shout of admiration which was practically universal.</p>

<p>It was about Christmas in that same year, 1870, that he who writes these
lines was first presented to Gabriel Rossetti. The impression on my
mental eye is as fresh as if it had been made yesterday, instead of
twelve years ago. He was a man of average height, commonly loosely clad
in black, so as to give one something of the notion of an abbé; the head
very full, and domed like that of Shakespeare, as it was then usual to
say&mdash;to my thinking more like that of Chaucer&mdash;in any case a head
surcharged with imagination and power, strongly Italian in color and
cast. The eyes were exceedingly deep set, in cavernous sockets; they
were large, and black, and full of a restless brilliance, a piercing
quality which consoled the shy novice by not being stationary. Lastly, a
voice of bell-like tone and sonority, a voice capable of expressing
without effort every shade of emotion from rage and terror to the most
sublime tenderness. I have never heard a voice so fitted for poetical
effect, so purely imaginative, and yet, in its absence of rhetoric, so
clear and various, as that of Gabriel Rossetti. I retain one special
memory of his reading in his own studio the unfinished MS. of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page296" name="page296"></a>(p. 296)</span>
"Rose Mary," in 1873, which surpassed in this direction any pleasure
which it has been my lot to enjoy; and on various occasions I have
listened to his reading of sonnets, his own and those of others, with a
sense that his intonation revealed a beauty in the form of that species
of verse which it had never been seen to possess before. I have already
spoken of his wonderful courtliness to a new acquaintance, his
bewitching air of sympathy; on a closer intimacy this stately manner
would break up into wild fits of mirth, and any sketch of Rossetti would
be incomplete that did not describe his loud and infectious laughter. He
lived very much apart from the every-day life of mankind, not
ostentatiously, but from a genuine lack of interest in passing events.
An old friend tells me that during the French Revolution he burst into
Rossetti's studio with the incredible news, "Louis-Philippe has landed
in England!" "Has he?" said Rossetti, calmly. "What has he come for?"
That certain political events, in which he saw a great symbolic
significance, could move him deeply, is easily proved by such sonnets as
the noble "On the Refusal of Aid between Nations," and "Czar Alexander
II." But such glances out of window into the living street were rare,
and formed no characteristic part of his scheme of life.</p>

<p>As a poet in these great years he possessed rare gifts of passionate
utterance, and harmony of vision and expression. Mr. Swinburne has
characterized these qualities in words which leave no later commentator
the chance of distinguishing himself. But it would be totally unjust,
even in so cursory and personal a sketch as this, to allow the
impression to go undisputed that Rossetti preferred the external form to
the inward substance of poetry. This charge was brought against him, as
it has always been brought against earnest students of poetic art. I
will rather quote a few words from a letter of Rossetti to me, written
in 1873, when he was composing his own <i>magnum opus</i> of "Rose Mary." I
have always felt them to be very salutary, none the less because it is
obvious that the writer did not at all times contrive, or perhaps
desire, to make them true in his own work:</p>

<p>"It seems to me that all poetry, to be really enduring, is bound to be
as <i>amusing</i> (however trivial the word may sound) as any other class of
literature; and I do not think that enough amusement to keep it alive
can ever be got out of incidents not amounting to events, or out of
travelling experiences of an ordinary kind however agreeably,
observantly, or even thoughtfully treated. I would eschew in writing all
themes that are not so trenchantly individualized as to leave no margin
for discursiveness."</p>

<p>During the last eight years of his life, Rossetti's whole being was
clouded by the terrible curse of an excitable
temperament&mdash;sleeplessness. To overcome this enemy, which interfered
with his powers of work and concentration of thought, he accepted the
treacherous aid of the new drug, chloral, which was then vaunted as
perfectly harmless in its effect upon the health. The doses of chloral
became more and more necessary to him, and I am told that at last they
became so frequent and excessive that no case has been recorded in the
annals of medicine in which one patient has taken so much, or even half
so much, chloral as Rossetti took. Under this unwholesome drug his
constitution, originally a magnificent <span class="pagenum"><a id="page297" name="page297"></a>(p. 297)</span> one, slipped
unconsciously into decay, the more stealthily that the poison seemed to
have no effect whatever on the powers of the victim's intellect. He
painted until physical force failed him; he wrote brilliantly to the
very last, and two sonnets dictated by him on his death-bed are
described to me as being entirely worthy of his mature powers. There is
something almost melancholy in such a proof of the superior vitality of
the brain. If the mind had shared the weakness of the body, the
insidious enemy might perhaps have been routed in time to secure the
elastic rebound of both. But when the chloral was stoutly met at last,
it was too late.</p>

<p>So at the age of fifty-four we have lost a man whom we should have
retained, in the nature of things, for twenty years longer in the
plentitude of his powers, but for a mistake in hygiene&mdash;a medical
experiment. His work of inspiring the young, of projecting his fiery
originality along the veins of others, was perhaps completed; it is
doubtful whether this can ever be continued with advantage through more
than two generations. The prophet is apt at last to become a tyrant, and
from this ill apotheosis Rossetti was spared. But there was no reason
why he should not, for at least a score of years, have produced noble
pictures and have written gorgeous poems, emphasizing a personal success
which he would have extended, though he hardly could have raised it. Yet
he was always a melancholy man; of late years he had become almost a
solitary man. Like Charles of Austria, he had disbanded his body-guard,
and had retired to the cloister. Perhaps a longer life would not have
brought much enjoyment with it. But these are idle speculations, and we
have rather to call to our remembrance the fact that one of the
brightest and most distinguished of our race, a man whose very existence
was a protest against narrowness of aim and feebleness of purpose, one
of the great torch-bearers in the procession of English art, has been
called from us in the prime of life, before the full significance of his
genius had been properly felt. He was the contemporary of some mighty
names older than his, yet there scarcely was to be found among them all
a spirit more thoroughly original; and surely, when the paltry conflicts
of passing taste are laid to rest forever, it will be found that this
man has written his signature indelibly on one of the principal pages of
the register of our intellectual history.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

</div>

<p>It is now eleven years since Gustave Doré died. He was an officer of the
Legion of Honor, had attained considerable wealth, and was probably more
widely known than any other artist of his day. His name was a household
word in two continents. Yet he died a disappointed and embittered man,
and is proclaimed by his friends as a neglected and misunderstood
genius. He was known the world over as the most astonishingly prolific
illustrator of books that has ever lived; he wished to be known in
France as a great painter and a great sculptor, and because the artists
and critics of France never seriously recognized his claims to this
glory, he seems to have become a victim of the mania of persecution, and
his naturally sunny nature was over-clouded with moroseness and
suspicion. Hailed by some as the emulator and equal of the great names
of the Italian Renaissance, and considered a great moral force&mdash;a
"preacher painter"&mdash;by others he has been denounced as "designer in
chief to the devil," and described as a man wallowing in all foulness
and horror, a sort of demon of frightful power. Both these extreme
judgments are English. The late Blanchard Jerrold, an intimate friend
and collaborator of the artist, takes the first view. Mr. Ruskin and Mr.
Hamerton have taken the second. Doré's own countrymen have never
accepted either. Just where, between them, the truth lies, as we see it,
we shall endeavor to show in this article.</p>

<p>The main facts of Doré's life may be dismissed very briefly. He was born
with a caul on January 6, 1832, in the Rue Bleue at Strasbourg, near the
Cathedral. About 1841 his father removed to Bourg, in the Department of
Ain, where he was chief government engineer of the department. These two
residences of the young artist are supposed to account for the mastery
of Gothic <span class="pagenum"><a id="page299" name="page299"></a>(p. 299)</span> architecture and of mountain scenery which his
admirers find in his mature work. He showed very early in life a passion
for drawing, and, as a small child, had always a pencil in his hand,
which he begged to have "sharpened at both ends," that he might work
longer without interruption. His father intended him for an engineer,
but he was determined from the first to be an artist. He was of a gay
and jovial disposition, given to pranks and practical jokes, and of an
athletic temperament. Théophile Gautier afterward called him a "gamin de
génie." In 1847, when he was fifteen years old, being in Paris with his
parents, he called upon Phillippon, the publisher, and showed him some
of his sketches. M. Phillippon looked at them, and sent a letter to
Doré's parents, persuading them to allow the boy to remain in Paris, and
promising them to begin using his work at once and to pay for it. Thus,
without any study of art whatever, he began his career, and in a few
years had produced a prodigious quantity of work, and was a celebrated
man before he was twenty. No one knows how many drawings he made. He
"lived like an Arab," worked early and late, and with astonishing
rapidity made thousands of drawings for the comic papers, besides early
beginning the publication of independent books. One estimate, which Mr.
Jerrold thinks excessive, credits him with having published forty
thousand drawings before he was forty! Mr. Jerrold himself reckons two
hundred and sixty-six drawings done in one year. His "Labors of
Hercules" was brought out in 1848, when he was sixteen, and before he
was twenty-seven he had published his "Holy Russia," his "Wandering
Jew," his illustrations to Balzac's "Contes Drôlatiques," to Rabelais,
and many other authors. His best work was done at an age when most
artists are painfully acquiring the rudiments of their art. We all know
the books that followed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he was determined to be known as a great painter, and, while
flooding the market with his countless illustrations, was working at
great canvases of Biblical subjects, which, though the French would not
accept them, were hugely admired in the Doré Gallery of London. Later he
tried sculpture also, and his last work was a monument to Alexandre
Dumas, which he made at his own expense, and presented to the city of
Paris. He died in the beginning of the year 1883, worn out with
excessive production&mdash;a great name, but an unsatisfied man.</p>

<p>Mr. Jerrold has divided his book into two parts, dealing first with Doré
the illustrator, and then with Doré the painter and sculptor. It is an
eminently natural arrangement, and, in our effort to arrive at Doré's
true position in art, we cannot do better than to follow it.</p>

<p>Doré's earliest work was frankly that of a caricaturist. He had a quick
eye, no training, and a certain extravagant imagination, and caricature
was his inevitable field. He was, however, as Mr. Jerrold himself
remarks, "a caricaturist who seldom raises a laugh." Not hearty fun,
still less delicate humor, was his. In the higher qualities of
caricature his contemporaries, Daumier and Gavarni, were vastly his
superiors. An exuberance of grotesque fancy and a recklessness of
exaggeration were his dominant notes. His earlier work, up to and
including <span class="pagenum"><a id="page300" name="page300"></a>(p. 300)</span> the Rabelais, is not really funny&mdash;to many minds it
is even painful&mdash;but it is unmistakably caricature of a dashing, savage
sort. To our mind it remains his best work, and that by which he is most
likely to live. At least it is the work that formed him and fixed his
characteristics, and an understanding of it is essential to any judgment
of him. The qualities and the defects of his later work&mdash;that which is
most praised and most blamed in his production&mdash;are inherent in the work
of this period, and are best explained by a reference to the latter.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, what has been denounced as his love of horrors and
of foulness, his delight in blood and massacre. He is scored for this as
if he were one of that modern French school, beginning, perhaps, with
Regnault, who have revelled in the realistic presentation of executions
and battles, and have sought to effect by sheer sensationalism what they
could not by gentler means. It is surprising that his critics have not
seen that Doré's battles are always, even to the end, the battles of a
caricaturist. His decapitated trunks, cloven heads, smoking hearts, arms
still fighting though severed from their bodies, are simply a debauch of
grim humor. There is never the slightest attempt to realize
carnage&mdash;only to convey, by the caricaturist's exaggeration, an idea of
colossally impossible bloodthirstiness. One may not enjoy this kind of
fun, but to take it seriously, as the emanation of a gloomy and diabolic
genius, is absurd.</p>

<p>The same test is equally destructive of much of the praise Doré has
received. He is constantly spoken of, even by severe critics of his
painting, as a great illustrator who identified himself with the minds
of one great writer after another. But Doré identified himself with no
one; he was always Doré. Even in these early drawings he cannot keep to
the spirit of the text, though the subjects suited him much better than
many he tried later. There is a great deal of broad gayety and "Gallic
wit" in the "Contes Drôlatiques," but it was not broad enough for Doré,
and he has converted its most human characters into impossible
grotesques.</p>

<p>Another thing for which Doré is praised is his wonderful memory. Mr.
Jerrold repeats more than once Doré's phrase, "I have lots of collodion
in my head," and recounts how he could scarcely be induced to make
sketches from nature, but relied upon his memory. He also speaks of
Doré's system of dividing and subdividing a subject, and noting the
details in their places, so that he could reproduce the whole afterward.
This question of work from memory is one of the most vital for an
understanding of Doré, and one of general interest in all matters of
art, and is worth attention. Of course, a man who made hundreds of
drawings every year could not work much from nature, and came to rely
upon his memory. But what is the nature of artistic memory, and how does
it perform its task? We think the truth is, that the artist who
habitually works from memory, fills in his details, not from memory of
the object, but from memory of the way he has formerly drawn similar
objects. He reverts to a series of formulæ that he has gradually
accumulated. This man must have a cloak. This is the way a cloak is
done. A hand? Nothing can be easier; the hand formula is ready. The
stock in trade of the professional illustrator and caricaturist is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page301" name="page301"></a>(p. 301)</span> made up of a thousand such formulæ&mdash;methods of expression that
convey the idea readily enough to the spectator, but have little
relation to fact. So it is that Doré never learned, in the true sense,
to draw. He had made for himself a sort of artistic shorthand, which
enabled him to convey his superabundant ideas quickly and certainly to
his public, but his drawing is what is called mannered in the extreme.
It is not representation of nature at all, but pure formula and chic. He
is said to be a master of drapery, but he never drew a single fold
correctly. He is said to show great knowledge of Gothic architecture,
but he never drew well a single column or finial. In his later years he
studied anatomy with great perseverance, and advocated the necessity of
dissection, saying, "Il faut fourrer la main dedans" (You must stick
your hand in it); but the manner was formed, and he never drew a leg
with a bone in it.</p>

<p>With this equipment he illustrated Don Quixote, Dante, the Bible. Is it
strange that he shows no sympathy with the grand simplicity of Dante, or
the subtle humor of Cervantes, and that we can only be thankful that he
never completed his projected illustrations to Shakespeare? Doré, the
illustrator, was fecund beyond precedent, possessed a certain strange
drollery, had a wonderful flow of ideas, but was superficial,
theatrical, and mannered, and as far from expressing real horror as from
expressing real fun. What shall we say of Doré the painter and sculptor?</p>

<p>Mr. Jerrold reports a discussion between Doré and Théophile Gautier, in
which the roles of artist and man of letters are strangely reversed.
"Gautier and Doré," he says, "disagreed fundamentally on the aims and
methods of art. Gautier loved correctness, perfect form&mdash;the technique,
in short, of art; whereas Doré contended that art which said nothing,
which conveyed no idea, albeit perfect in form and color, missed the
highest quality and raison d'être of art." What is plain from this is,
that Gautier was an artist and cared first of all for art, while Doré
was never an artist, properly speaking, at all, and never understood the
artist's passion for perfection. To Doré, what was necessary was to
express himself anyhow&mdash;who cared if the style was defective, the
drawing bad, the color crude? The idea was the thing. His admirers can
defend him only on this ground, and they adopt of necessity the
Philistine point of view. The artists of Doré's time and country were
very clear in their opinion. "The painters," says Mr. Jerrold, "said he
could not paint."</p>

<p>The sculptors admitted that he had ideas in his groups, but he was not
sculpturesque. His friends protest against this judgment, and attribute
it, <i>ad nauseam</i>, to "malevolence" and "envy." What if his technique
was less brilliant than that of Hals, they say; what if his shadows are
less transparent than those of Rembrandt (and they will make no meaner
comparison)? He is "teeming with noble thoughts," and these will put his
work "on a level with the masterpieces of the Italian masters of the
sixteenth century." It is the conception, the creation&mdash;not the perfect
painting of legs and arms and heads, the harmonious grouping, the happy
and delicate combination of color&mdash;by which the observer is held spell
bound. All these qualities, which his admirers grudgingly admit that
Doré had <span class="pagenum"><a id="page302" name="page302"></a>(p. 302)</span> not, are classed as "mere dexterity," and are not
considered worth a second thought.</p>

<p>This is the true literary gospel of art, but it is one that no artist,
and no critic who has any true feeling of art, has ever accepted or will
ever accept. Thoughts, ideas, conceptions, may enhance the value of a
work of art, provided it is first of all a piece of beautiful art in
itself, but they have never preserved, and never will preserve from
oblivion bad painting or bad sculpture. The style is the artist, if not
the man; and of the two, beautiful painting with no idea at all
(granting, for the sake of argument, that it exists), will ever be
infinitely more valuable to the world than the lame expression of the
noblest thoughts. What may be the real value of Doré's thoughts is
therefore a question with which we have no concern. As painter and
sculptor, his lack of education and his great technical
imperfections&mdash;his bad drawing, false light and shade, and crude
color&mdash;relegate him forever to a rank far below mediocrity. Such
reputation as he has is the result of the admiration of those altogether
ignorant of art, but possessed of enough literary ability to trumpet
abroad their praises of "great conceptions," and will as surely fade
away to nothing as the reputation of such simple painters as Van Der
Meer or Chardin will continue to grow, while painting as an art is loved
and understood.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<h3>HANDEL<br>

By <span class="smcap">C. E. Bourne</span><br>

(1685-1759)</h3>


<p>George Frederick Handel, of whom Haydn once reverently said, "He is the
master of us all," was born at Halle, in Lower Saxony, on February 23,
1685. His father was a surgeon, and sixty-three years of age at the time
of his birth&mdash;a terribly severe old man, who, almost before his son was
born, had determined that he should be a lawyer. The little child knew
nothing of the fate before him, he only found that he was never allowed
to go near a musical instrument, much as he wanted to hear its sweet
sounds, and the obstinate father even took him away from the public
day-school for the simple reason that the musical gamut was taught there
in addition to ordinary reading, writing, and arithmetic.</p>

<p>But love always "finds out the way," and his mother or nurse managed to
procure for him the forbidden delights; a small clavichord, or dumb
spinet, with the strings covered with strips of cloth to deaden the
sound, was found for the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page303" name="page303"></a>(p. 303)</span> child, and this he used to keep hidden
in the garret, creeping away to play it in the night-time, when everyone
was asleep, or whenever his father was away from home doctoring his
patients.</p>

<a id="img031" name="img031"></a>
<div class="floatright">
<img src="images/img031.jpg" width="200" height="263" alt="Handel." title="">
</div>

<p>But, at last, when George Frederick was seven years of age, the old man
was compelled to change his views. It happened in this way. He set out
one day on a visit to the court of the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, where
another son by a former marriage was a page. George Frederick had been
teasing his father to let him go with him to see his elder brother, whom
he had not yet met, but this was refused. When old Handel started by the
stagecoach the next morning, the persistent little fellow was on the
watch; he began running after it, and at length the father was
constrained to stop the coach and take the boy in. So, though at the
expense of a severe scolding, the child had his way and was allowed to
go on to Saxe-Weissenfels. When there, the chapel, with the beautiful
organ, was the great attraction, and George Frederick, as indomitable
then as he was in after-life, found his way into the organ loft, and
when the regular service was over, contrived to take the organist's
place, and began a performance of his own; and strange to say, though he
had not had the slightest training, a melody with chords and the correct
harmonies was heard. The duke had not left the chapel, and noticing the
difference in style from that of the ordinary organist, inquired as to
the player, and when the little boy was brought to him he soon
discovered, by the questions he put, the great passion for music which
possessed the child. The duke, a sensible man, told the father it would
be wrong to oppose the inclination of a boy who already displayed such
extraordinary genius; and old Handel, either convinced, or at any rate
submitting to the duke's advice, promised to procure for his son regular
musical instruments. Handel never afterward forgot the debt of gratitude
he owed to the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels for this intercession.</p>

<p>On his return to Halle he became the pupil of Zachau, the organist of
the cathedral there. This man was an excellent teacher and a sound
musician. Before the pupil was nine years old his instructor used to set
him to write fugues and motets as exercises, and before long the boy was
allowed to play the organ at the cathedral services on Sunday, whenever
the elder musician was inclined to linger over his breakfast or to take
a holiday. At last, when young Handel was nine years old, the master
honestly confessed that his pupil knew more music than he himself did,
and advised that he should be sent to Berlin for a course of further
study there. Thither he accordingly went in the year 1696.</p>

<p>In Berlin the boy of eleven years was soon recognized as a prodigy.
There he met two Italian composers of established reputation, Bononcini
and Attilio Ariosti, both of whom he was to encounter in after-life,
though under very different circumstances, in London. Bononcini, who was
of a sour and jealous disposition, soon conceived a dislike for the
gifted little fellow, and attempted to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page304" name="page304"></a>(p. 304)</span> injure him by composing
a piece for the harpsichord full of the most extraordinary difficulties,
and then asking him to play it at sight. The boy, however, at once
executed it without a mistake, and thus the malicious schemer was foiled
by his own device. Attilio was of a different disposition; he praised
the young musician to the skies, and was never weary of sitting by his
side at the organ or harpsichord, and hearing him improvise for hours.
The Elector of Brandenburg also conceived a great admiration for the
boy's talents, and offered to send him to Italy. On old Handel being
consulted, however, he pleaded that he was now an old man, and wished
his son to remain near him. In consequence of this, probably much to the
boy's disappointment, he was brought back to Halle, and there set to
work again under his old master, Zachau.</p>

<p>Soon after this return his father died, in 1697, leaving hardly anything
for his family, and young Handel had now to seriously bestir himself to
make a living. With this object he went to Hamburg, where he obtained a
place as second violin in the Opera-house. Soon after arriving there,
the post of organist at Lübeck became vacant, and Handel was a candidate
for it. But a peculiar condition was attached to the acceptance of the
office; the new organist must marry the daughter of the old one! And, as
Handel either did not approve of the lady, or of matrimony generally
(and in fact he never was married), he promptly retired from the
competition. At first, no one suspected the youth's talents, for he
amused himself by pretending to be an ignoramus, until one day the
accompanyist on the harpsichord (then the most important instrument in
an orchestra) was absent, and young Handel took his place, astonishing
everybody by his masterly touch. Probably this discovery aroused the
jealousy of some of his brother-artists, for soon afterward a duel took
place between him and Matheson, a clever composer and singer, who one
night, in the midst of a quarrel on leaving the theatre, gave him a box
on the ear; swords were drawn, and the duel took place there and then
under the portico of the theatre. Fortunately Matheson's weapon was
shivered by coming in contact with a metal button on his opponent's
coat. Explanations were then offered, and the two adversaries became
friends&mdash;indeed, close friends&mdash;afterward. "Almira, Queen of Castile,"
Handel's first opera, was brought out in Hamburg in 1705, and was
followed by two others, "Nero," and "Daphne," all received with great
favor, and frequently performed.</p>

<p>Handel's River-Concert for George I.</p>
</div>

<p>But the young musician determined to visit Italy as soon as possible,
and after staying in Hamburg three years, and having, besides the money
he sent his mother, saved two hundred ducats for travelling expenses, he
was able to set off on the journey, then one of the great events in a
musician's lifetime. He visited Florence, Venice, Rome, and Naples, in
almost every city writing operas, which we are told were produced with
the most brilliant success. At Venice an opera was sought for from him,
and in three weeks he had written "Agrippina." When produced, the people
received it with frantic enthusiasm, the theatre resounding with shouts
of "Viva il caro Sassone!" (Long live the dear Saxon!) The following
story illustrates the extraordinary fame he so quickly acquired in
Italy. He <span class="pagenum"><a id="page305" name="page305"></a>(p. 305)</span> arrived at Venice during the middle of the
carnival, and was taken to a masked ball, and there played the
harpsichord, still keeping on his mask. Domenico Scarlatti, the most
famous harpsichord player of his age, on hearing him, exclaimed, "Why,
it's the devil, or else the Saxon whom everyone is talking about!" In
1709 he returned to Hanover, and was appointed by the Elector George of
Brunswick, afterward King George I., of England, his Court
Capellmeister.</p>

<p>Handel's wanderings next led him to England, where he was treated with
so much honor that he showed no great hurry to return to Hanover, and,
in fact, he remained in England and coolly ignored his engagement as
Capellmeister. But an awkward piece of retribution was at hand. The
Elector of Hanover, on the death of Queen Anne, came to England as the
new king, and Handel, his delinquent Capellmeister, could hardly expect
to receive any share of the royal favor in future. With the help of a
friend of his, Baron Kilmanseck, he determined, however, to make an
attempt to conciliate the king, and accordingly he wrote twenty-five
short concerted pieces of music, and made arrangements for these to be
performed by musicians in a boat following the royal barge on the
Thames, one day when the king went on an excursion up the river for a
picnic. The king recognized the composer at once by his style, and spoke
in terms of approbation of the music, and the news was quickly conveyed
by his friend to the anxious musician. This is the story of the origin
of the famous "Water Music." Soon afterward the king allowed Handel to
appear before him to play the harpsichord accompaniments to some sonatas
executed by Geminiani, a celebrated Italian violinist, and finally peace
was made between them, Handel being appointed music-master to the royal
children, and receiving an additional pension of £200. In 1726 a private
Act of Parliament was passed, making George Frederick Handel a
naturalized Englishman.</p>

<p>In the year 1720 a number of noblemen formed themselves into a company
for the purpose of reviving Italian opera in London, at the Haymarket
Theatre, and subscribed a capital of £50,000. The king himself
subscribed £1,000, and allowed the society to take the name of the Royal
Academy of Music, and at first everything seemed to promise the most
brilliant success. Handel was appointed director of the music. Bononcini
and Attilio Ariosti, his old acquaintances in Berlin, were also
attracted by this new operatic venture to London, and their arrival was
followed by a competition of a very novel character. The libretto of a
new opera, "Muzio Scævola," was divided between the three composers.
Attilio was to put the first act to music, Bononcini the second, and
Handel the third. We need hardly wonder that the victory is said to have
rested with the last and youngest of the trio, although at this time the
cabals against him, which afterward were to do him such grievous harm,
had already commenced.</p>

<p>Handel still clung to the operatic speculation; and when he had to leave
the Haymarket Theatre, which was given up to another Italian company
with the famous Farinelli, from Lincoln's Inn Fields, undauntedly he
changed to the Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre, and there commenced again.
More operas were produced, with the one unvarying tale of fiasco, and
at last, in 1737, having lost the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page306" name="page306"></a>(p. 306)</span> whole of his hardly earned
money, Handel was compelled to close the theatre, and, worse than all,
to suspend payment for a time. Happily he now turned his thoughts to
oratorio. "Saul" and "Israel in Egypt" were composed in quick
succession; the last gigantic work being written in the almost
incredibly short space of twenty-seven days. How great it is everyone
now knows, but, at the time the colossal choruses were actually
considered a great deal too heavy and monotonous; and Handel, always
quick in resource, at the second performance introduced a number of
operatic songs to make them go down better, and after the third
performance the piece was withdrawn altogether. Fortunately, opinions
have changed since then. These works were followed by his fine setting
of Dryden's "Ode on St. Cecilia's Day," and Milton's "L'Allegro" and "Il
Penseroso;" but it cannot be said that his pecuniary affairs were
materially improved by their production.</p>

<p>The first performance of his greatest oratorio, the "Messiah," took
place at Neale's Music Hall, in Dublin, on April 18, 1742, at mid-day,
and, apropos of the absurdities of fashion, it may be noticed that the
announcements contained the following request: "That ladies who honor
this performance with their presence, will be pleased to come without
hoops, as it will greatly increase the charity by making room for more
company." The work was gloriously successful, and £400 were obtained the
first day for the Dublin charities. Handel seems always to have had a
special feeling with regard to this masterpiece of his&mdash;as if it were
too sacred to be merely used for making money by, like his other works.
He very frequently assisted at its performance for the benefit of the
Foundling Hospital, and he left the score as a precious gift to the
governor of that institution. This work alone brought no less a sum than
£10,299 to the funds of the hospital. In this connection a fine saying
of his may be repeated. Lord Kinnoul had complimented him on the noble
"entertainment" which by the "Messiah" he had lately given the town. "My
Lord," said Handel, "I should be sorry if I only entertained them&mdash;I
wish to make them better." And when someone questioned him on his
feelings when composing the "Hallelujah Chorus," he replied in his
peculiar English, "I did think I did see all heaven before me, and the
great God himself." What a fine saying that was of poor old George III.,
in describing the "pastoral symphony" in this oratorio&mdash;"I could see the
stars shining through it!"</p>

<p>The now constant custom of the audience to rise and remain standing
during the performance of this chorus, is said to have originated in the
following manner: On the first production of the work in London, "the
audience were exceedingly struck and affected by the music in general;
but when that chorus struck up, 'For the Lord God Omnipotent' in the
'Hallelujah,' they were so transported that they all together, with the
king (who happened to be present), started up and remained standing till
the chorus ended." "This anecdote I had from Lord Kinnoul." So says Dr.
Beattie, the once famous poet, in one of his letters.</p>

<p>The "Messiah" was commenced on August 22, 1741, finished on September
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page307" name="page307"></a>(p. 307)</span> 12th, and the orchestration filled up two days afterward&mdash;the
whole work thus being completed in twenty-three days. Handel was
fifty-six years old at the time.</p>

<p>The next ten years of the life of the "Goliath of Music," as he has been
called, are marked by some of the most splendid achievements of his
genius. "Samson," the "Dettingen Te Deum," "Joseph," "Belshazzar," "The
Occasional Oratorio," "Judas Maccabeus," "Joshua," "Solomon," and,
"Theodora," being composed by him during this time, when, already an old
man, it might have been thought that he would have taken some repose
after the labors of so toilsome and troubled a life. But, oak-like, he
was one of those who mature late; like Milton, his greatest works were
those of his old age.</p>

<p>But a terrible misfortune was approaching&mdash;his eyesight was failing. The
"drop serene," of which Milton speaks so pathetically, had fallen on his
eyes, and at the time when, in February, 1752, he was composing his last
work, "Jephtha" (the one containing "Deeper and Deeper Still," and "Waft
her, Angels"), the effort in tracing the lines is, in the original MS.,
very painfully apparent. Soon afterward he submitted to three
operations, but they were in vain, and henceforth all was to be dark to
him. His sole remaining work was now to improvise on the organ, and to
play at performances of his oratorios. There is a pathetic story told of
an incident that occurred on one occasion, when "Samson" was given.
While the magnificent air,</p>

<p class="poem30">
  Total eclipse! no sun, no moon!<br>
  All dark, amidst the blaze of noon.<br>
  O glorious light! no cheering ray<br>
  To glad my eyes with welcome day.<br>
  Why thus deprived thy prime decree?<br>
  Sun, moon, and stars are dark to me&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">was being sung by Beard, the tenor, the blind old man, seated at the
organ, was seen to tremble and grow pale, and then, when he was led
forward to the audience to receive their applause, tears were in the
eyes of nearly everyone present at the sight. It was like the scene that
is described in Beethoven's life on the occasion of that composer's
appearance, when almost totally deaf, to conduct his great Choral
Symphony at Vienna.</p>

<p>One night, on returning home from a performance of the "Messiah" at
Covent Garden, Handel was seized with sudden weakness and retired
hurriedly to bed, from which he was never to rise again. He prayed that
he might breathe his last on Good Friday, "in hope of meeting his God,
his sweet Lord and Saviour on the day of his resurrection." And
strangely enough his wish was granted, for on Good Friday, April 13,
1759, he quietly passed away from this life, being then seventy-four
years of age. His remains were laid in Poets' Corner in Westminster
Abbey, and the place is marked by a statue by Roubilliac, representing
him leaning over a table covered with musical instruments, his hand
holding a pen, and before him is laid the "Messiah," open at the words,
"I know that my Redeemer liveth."<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

</div>

<p>Leopold Mozart was a violinist in the band of Archbishop Sigismund, the
reigning Prince of Salzburg, and it was probably in compliment to his
master that he bestowed on the youngest of his seven children the name
of Joannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Sigismundus. Born on
January 27, 1756, this child was destined to make the name of Mozart
famous wherever music is known; and surely no more beautiful
life&mdash;beautiful in itself and in the works of immortal beauty which in
its short course were produced&mdash;has ever been lived by anyone of those
to whom the crown of inspired singers and an enduring monument in the
temple of art has been given. "Look around," was the epitaph on a great
architect. "Listen," is the most fitting tribute to the wonderful genius
of a Mozart.</p>

<p>Infant prodigies very often turn out to be nobodies in after-life. But
Mozart was an exception; and though he might well have been called "the
marvellous boy," his latest works&mdash;and he died at the early age of
thirty-five&mdash;were undoubtedly his grandest and most perfect. He began
very early to compose. One of these first attempts was a concerto so
difficult that no one could play it; but the child undauntedly said,
"Why, that's the very reason why it is called a concerto; people must
practise it before they can play it perfectly."</p>

<p>Wolfgang and his sister, Nannerl, as he used to call her, had been taken
by their father, in 1762, to Vienna, where the children played the piano
before the Empress Maria Theresa and her husband. Little Wolfgang was
here, as everywhere, perfectly at his ease, with a simplicity and
childish grace that won every heart. When he had been playing for some
time, he jumped without ceremony on the lap of the empress, and kissed
her heartily for being so good to him. Little Marie Antoinette, her
daughter, afterward the ill-fated wife of Louis XVI., and then about the
same age as Wolfgang, he treated in almost the same way. He had slipped
on the polished floor, to which he was unaccustomed, and the little
princess had hurried forward to raise him up, on which he promptly said,
"You are good; I will marry you." The empress asked why he wished this,
to which he answered, "Out of gratitude; she was kind, while her sister
took no notice of me" (she had not come forward to help him). After
returning <span class="pagenum"><a id="page309" name="page309"></a>(p. 309)</span> to Salzburg, Leopold Mozart, in the spring of 1763,
took his children on a more lengthy tour to Munich, Paris, London, and
The Hague, and everywhere their playing, especially Wolfgang's
performances on the organ, which he had now learned, were listened to
with delight and astonishment. At Heidelberg the priest of the Church of
the Holy Ghost engraved on the organ the boy's name and the date of his
visit, in remembrance of "this wonder of God," as he called the child.
At London, old Mozart says, they were received, on April 27th, by King
George III. and Queen Caroline, at the palace, and remained from six to
nine o'clock. The king placed before the boy compositions of Bach and
Handel, all of which he played at sight perfectly; he had also the honor
of accompanying the queen in a song. "On leaving the palace," the
careful father says, "we received a present of 24 guineas."</p>

<p>A great delight was now before him, for his father had resolved on a
journey to Italy, then far more than now the land of music. How much
this visit did for the young maestro it is impossible to say; he has
not, like Mendelssohn, left us an "Italian Symphony," recording the
impressions which that sunny spot of classic beauty had made upon him,
but there can be little doubt of the great influence it had on the whole
of his after-life. There are some significant words which he wrote eight
years later to his father from Paris: "You must faithfully promise to
let me see Italy again in order to refresh my life. I do entreat of you
to confer this happiness upon me." In Mantua, Milan, Bologna (where he
had the good fortune to meet the learned Padre Martini, one of the
soundest musicians of his age, and for whom he ever afterward maintained
a warm attachment), Florence, Rome, and Naples, the young genius was
received everywhere with enthusiasm by the crowds who came to hear him.
In Naples the superstitious people believed that there was magic in his
playing, and pointed to a ring on his left hand as the cause of his
wonderful dexterity; and it was only when he had taken this off, and
gone on playing just the same, that they had to acknowledge it was
simply the perfection of art.</p>

<p>There is something sad in contrasting these brilliant early days with
the anxious times that came later on, when the great Mozart was
compelled to wait in the ante-chambers of the great, dine with their
lacqueys, give lessons to stupid young countesses, and write begging
letters to his friends; yet, in reality, those later days, when "Don
Giovanni," "Die Zauberflöte," and the "Requiem," were composed, were the
truly brilliant ones. And it may be that the very greatness came, in
some measure, from the sorrow and pain; that Mozart, like so many others
of the world's great singers, "learnt in suffering what he taught in
song."</p>

<p>On his return to Munich, after composing a comic opera in the Italian
style, "La Finta Giardiniera," which had a great success, young Mozart,
who had been very shabbily treated by Archbishop Hieronymus&mdash;of whose
spiteful conduct we shall hear more hereafter&mdash;the successor of
Sigismund, determined to resign his situation in the court band, and to
set out on his travels again, giving concerts from place to place, and
everywhere looking out for some suitable appointment that might afford
him a permanent income. This time his father was refused <span class="pagenum"><a id="page310" name="page310"></a>(p. 310)</span>
permission to travel, and, as on his exertions depended the support of
the whole family, he remained behind, while Frau Mozart, the mother,
accompanied young Wolfgang. In 1777, now a young man of twenty-one, he
set out upon his second great artistic tour, buoyant with hope, and with
all the beautiful audacity of young genius determined to conquer the
world. This time it was not the infant prodigy whom men listened to, but
the matured musician and the composer of melodies sweeter than men had
ever listened to before. But the tale is changed now. True, there are
triumphs to be spoken of, flattery from the great, and presents sent in
recompense for his marvellous playing (he tells one day of his chagrin
in receiving from a certain prince a gold watch, instead of money that
he sorely wanted&mdash;and, besides, he had five watches already!); but
rebuffs, intrigues, and all sorts of petty machinations against him,
make the tale a sadder one; and so it continued to be to the end.</p>

<p>From Munich&mdash;where it had been hoped that the elector would have given
him an appointment at court, but he was only told to go to Italy and
become famous, "it was too early yet to think about becoming a
Capellmeister"&mdash;he went to Augsburg, spending some pleasant days there
in the society of a cousin, Marianne, nicknamed by him Bäsle, a merry,
open-hearted girl of nineteen.</p>

<p>Thence, he went on to Mannheim, a town that is memorable as the place
where he first met the Webers, and made the acquaintance of Herr
Cannabich, the director of the music at the elector's court, and one who
proved a stanch friend through everything to the young composer.
Cannabich had a daughter named Rosa, a girl of thirteen, exceedingly
pretty and clever, and Wolfgang appears to have admired her very much,
and perhaps for a time to have flirted and been in love with her. He
wrote her a sonata, and was delighted with the way in which she played
it; the andante, he said, he had composed to represent her, and when it
was finished he vowed she was just what the andante was. But this little
love affair, if it existed, soon was forgotten in a more serious one
with Aloysia Weber. Her father was a theatre copyist in poor
circumstances. There were a number of children, and she was a beautiful
girl of fifteen, with a magnificent voice. She was cousin, by the way,
to Weber, afterward composer of the "Freischütz." Mozart was so charmed
with her voice that he undertook to give her lessons, and we soon hear
of him composing airs for her and meditating a concert tour in Italy in
company with her, and her father and sister. In writing of it to his own
father he sets out the advantages to be gained by co-partnership, and
very prosaically says: "Should we stay long anywhere, the eldest
daughter [Josepha, afterward Frau Hofer, for whom Mozart wrote the part
of Astrafiammente in the "Zauberflöte"] would be of the greatest use to
us; for we could have our own ménage, as she understands cooking." But
papa Mozart decidedly objected. "Your proposal to travel about with Herr
Weber&mdash;N. B., two daughters&mdash;has driven me nearly wild," and he
straightway orders his son off to Paris, whither, with a parting present
of a pair of mittens knitted for him by Mlle. Weber, he reluctantly sets
out in company with his mother.</p>

<p>His stay in Paris during the next year was not very eventful, and a
symphony <span class="pagenum"><a id="page311" name="page311"></a>(p. 311)</span> produced at the Concerts Spirituels seems to have been
his most successful work at this time. It was clever and lively, full of
striking effects, and was most warmly applauded. He says: "The moment
the symphony was over I went off in my joy to the Palais Royal, where I
took a good ice, told my beads, as I had vowed, and went home, where I
am happiest and always shall be happiest." A great sorrow came to him
here in the death of his mother. Owing to the great expense of living in
Paris, they had been compelled to live together in a small, dark room,
so cramped for space that there was not even room for the indispensable
piano. Here she was taken ill, and though for fourteen days Wolfgang
most devotedly attended to her wants, she died in his arms. The letters
in which he breaks the news to his father and sister are full of the
most beautiful tenderness and forgetfulness of his own grief in
solicitude for theirs. Things did not indeed prosper with him in Paris;
he tried to give lessons, but the ladies whom he taught paid him very
shabbily, and the labor of getting from one part of the city to another
to teach was so great that he found it difficult to give the time he
wished to composition.</p>

<p>Music in Paris, just then, was at a low ebb. Vapidly pretty Italian
operas were in fashion, and Piccinni was the favorite composer. It was
some years afterward that the great contest between the Piccinnists and
Gluckists culminated in the victory of the latter, though "Alceste," had
already been produced, and "Iphigenia" was soon to follow. Mozart was a
fervent admirer of Gluck, and the music of the older master had
evidently an important influence on that of the younger and more gifted
composer.</p>

<p>Once more his thoughts were turned to Salzburg, for two of the leading
musicians there having died, the Archbishop Hieronymus offered their
posts to the Mozarts, father and son, at a salary of a thousand florins
for the two. The father anxiously entreated his son to return and accept
this offer, mentioning as a further bait, that Aloysia Weber would
probably be engaged to sing in Salzburg. Much as Wolfgang hated
Salzburg, or rather the people living there, his love for his father and
sister prevailed over his aversion; and though with no pleasure at all
in the prospect of seeing the hateful archbishop again, he set out from
Paris, travelling to Salzburg in very leisurely fashion via Strasbourg,
Mannheim, and Munich. At Strasbourg he was induced to give several
concerts, but they were not pecuniary successes, and he did not make by
any one more than three louis d'or. But how the artist peeps out in
every line of the letters in which he describes these! After saying how
few were present, and how cold it was, he proceeds: "But I soon warmed
myself, to show the Strasbourg gentlemen how little I cared, and played
to them a long time for my own amusement, giving a concerto more than I
had promised, and at the close extemporizing. It is now over, but at all
events I gained honor and fame."</p>

<p>At Munich a great shock awaited him. He visited the Webers, and being in
mourning for his mother, wore, after the French fashion, a red coat with
black buttons. When he appeared, Aloysia hardly seemed to recognize him,
and her coldness was so marked, that Mozart quietly seated himself at
the piano, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page312" name="page312"></a>(p. 312)</span> sang in a loud voice, "Ich lass das Mädchen gern
das mich nicht will" (I gladly give up the girl who slights me). It was
all over, and he had to bear the loss of the fickle girl as best he
might. There is a significant line in one of his letters at this time to
his father: "In my whole life I never wrote worse than I do to-day, but
I really am unfit for anything; my heart is so full of tears." After two
years' absence he returned home to Salzburg, where he was warmly
welcomed back. Here he remained for a little while, and wrote his first
serious opera, "Idomeneo," to the text of an Abbe Varesco, a Salzburger.
This opera Beethoven thought the finest of all that Mozart wrote. It was
brought out at Munich in January, 1781, and was brilliantly successful.
In the March following, an order was received from the archbishop to
follow him to Vienna, where he wished to appear with all the full pomp
and brilliant retinue of a prince of the church; and as one of this
retinue Mozart had to follow him, little thinking at the time that he
should never return to Salzburg, but that Vienna henceforth was to be
his home.</p>

<p>In Vienna he found that he had to live in the archbishop's house, and
was looked upon there as one of the ordinary servants. He says, "We dine
at eleven o'clock in the forenoon, unluckily rather too early an hour
for me. Our party consists of the two valets, the comptroller, Herr
Zetti, the confectioner, the two cooks, Cecarilli, Brunetti (two
singers), and my insignificant self. N. B.&mdash;The two valets sit at the
head of the table. I have, at all events, the honor to be placed above
the cooks; I almost believe I am back to Salzburg."</p>

<p>Mozart was a true gentleman, with no foolish false pride, but with the
honorable self-respect that every gentleman must possess, and it was
very galling to him to have to suffer such odious treatment from the
mean-spirited archbishop. Indeed, it was only for his father's sake that
he submitted to the continued contumely and petty slights to which the
archbishop delighted in subjecting him. At last the open rupture came.
The archbishop called him a knave and dissolute fellow, and told him to
be off; and when Mozart waited upon Count Arco, the principal official,
to obtain the regular dismissal that was necessary, the fellow poured
abuse upon him, and actually kicked him out of the room. Poor Mozart was
in a state of violent excitement after this outrage, and for some days
was so ill that he could not continue his ordinary work. But now at
least he was free, and though his father, like a timid, prudent old man,
bewailed the loss of the stipend which his son had been receiving,
Mozart himself knew that the release was entirely for the best.</p>

<p>In 1782 appeared "Die Entführung aus dem Serail," his first really
important opera, full of beautiful airs, which at once became enormously
popular with the Viennese. The Emperor Joseph II. knew very little about
music, but, as frequently happens in such cases, considered that he
possessed prodigious taste. On hearing it he said, "Much too fine for
our ears, dear Mozart; and what a quantity of notes!"</p>

<p>The bold reply to this was, "Just as many notes as are necessary, your
Majesty."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page313" name="page313"></a>(p. 313)</span> Much of the delight which Mozart felt in the success of the
opera arose from the fact that it enabled him seriously to contemplate
marriage. Aloysia Weber had been faithless to him, but there was another
sister&mdash;with no special beauty save that of bright eyes, a comely
figure, and a cheerful, amiable disposition&mdash;Constanze, whom he now
hoped to make his wife. His father objected to all of the Weber family,
and there was some difficulty in obtaining the paternal consent; but at
last the marriage took place, on August 4, 1782. How truly he loved his
wife from first to last, his letters abundantly show; her frequent
illnesses were afterward a great and almost constant source of expense
to him, but he never ceased to write to her with the passionate ardor of
a young lover. He says: "I found that I never prayed so fervently, or
confessed so piously, as by her side; she felt the same." And now for
some time everything went smoothly in the modest little ménage in
Vienna. Mozart had plenty of lessons to give, but none of the
commissions for operas which he would have wished.</p>

<p>Passing over a visit to Leipsic&mdash;where he studied with the keenest
delight a number of the unpublished works of the great Sebastian
Bach&mdash;and to Berlin, he returned to Vienna, and at once set to work upon
some quartets which the King of Prussia had ordered from him. "Cosi fan
tutte," a comic opera, with the beautifully flowing music that only
Mozart could write, but with a stupid plot that has prevented its
frequent repetition in later times; and the glorious "Zauberflöte,"
written to assist a theatrical manager, Schikaneder, were his next
works. At this time a strange melancholy began to show itself in his
letters&mdash;it may be that already his overwrought brain was conscious that
the end was not far distant. Such lines as these, pathetic and sad in
their simple and almost childlike expression, occur in a letter he wrote
during a short absence from his wife, at Frankfort, in 1790: "I am as
happy as a child at the thought of returning to you. If people could see
into my heart I should almost feel ashamed&mdash;all there is cold, cold as
ice. Were you with me, I should possibly take more pleasure in the
kindness of those I meet here, but all seems to me so empty." On his
return to Vienna pecuniary want was rather pressingly felt; his silver
plate had to be pawned, and a perfidious friend, Stadler, made away with
the tickets, and the silver was never redeemed. On one occasion Joseph
Deiner, the landlord of the "Silberne Schlange," chanced to call upon
him, and was surprised to find Mozart and his wife Constanze dancing
round the room. The laughing explanation was that they had no firewood
in the house, and so were trying to warm themselves with dancing. Deiner
at once offered to send in firewood, Mozart promising to pay as soon as
he could.</p>

<p>That grand work, the "Zauberflöte," had just been completed when a
strange commission was given him. One day a tall, haggard-looking man,
dressed in gray, with a very sombre expression of countenance, called
upon Mozart, bringing with him an anonymous letter. This letter
contained an inquiry as to the sum for which he would write a mass for
the dead, and in how short a time this could be completed. Mozart
consulted his wife, and the sum of fifty ducats was mentioned. The
stranger departed, and soon returned with the money, promising Mozart a
further sum on completion, and also mentioned that he might as <span class="pagenum"><a id="page314" name="page314"></a>(p. 314)</span>
well spare the trouble of finding out who had given this commission, for
it would be entirely useless. We now know that the commission had really
been given by Count Walsegg, a foolish nobleman, whose wife had died,
and who wanted, by transcribing Mozart's score, to pass it off as his
own composition&mdash;and this he actually did after the composer's death.
Poor Mozart, in the weak state of health in which he now was, with
nerves unstrung and over-excited brain, was strangely impressed by this
visit, and soon the fancy took firm possession of him that the messenger
had arrived with a mandate from the unseen world, and that the "Requiem"
he was to write was for himself. Not the less did he ardently set to
work on it. Hardly, however, was it commenced than he was compelled to
write another opera, "La Clemenza di Tito," for which a commission had
been given him by the Bohemian Estates, for production on the occasion
of the Emperor Leopold's coronation in their capital. This was
accomplished in the short space of eighteen days, and though it does not
contain the best music, yet the overture and several of the numbers are
full of a piquant beauty and liveliness well suiting the festival of a
people's rejoicing. But a far greater work, the "Zauberflöte," was
produced in Vienna shortly afterward. It did not take very well at
first, but subsequent performances went better.</p>

<p>Mozart singing his Requiem.</p>
</div>

<p>His labors in bringing out the "Zauberflöte" over, Mozart returned to
the "Requiem" he had already commenced, but while writing he often had
to sink back in his chair, being seized with short swoons. Too plainly
was his strength exhausted, but he persisted in his solemn work. One
bright November morning he was walking with Constanze in the Prater, and
sadly pointing out to her the falling leaves, and speaking of death,
with tears in his eyes, he added; "I well know I am writing this
'Requiem' for myself. My own feelings tell me that I shall not last
long. No doubt some one has given me poison&mdash;I cannot get rid of this
thought." With these gloomy fancies haunting his mind, he rapidly grew
worse, and soon could not leave his room. The performances of the
"Zauberflöte" were still going on, and extraordinarily successful. He
took the greatest interest in hearing of them, and at night would take
out his watch and note the time&mdash;"Now the first act is over, now is the
time for the great Queen of Night." The day before his death he said to
his wife, "Oh, that I could only once more hear my 'Flauto Magico!'"
humming, in scarcely audible voice, the lively bird-catcher song. The
same day, at two o'clock in the afternoon, he called his friends
together, and asked for the score of his nearly completed "Requiem" to
be laid on his bed. Benedict Schack sang the soprano; his
brother-in-law, Hofer, the tenor; Gerl, the bass; and Mozart himself
took the alto in a weak but delicately clear voice. They had got through
the various parts till they came to the "Lacrymosa," when Mozart burst
into tears, and laid the score aside. The next day (Sunday), he was
worse, and said to Sophie, his sister-in-law, "I have the taste of death
on my tongue, I smell the grave, and who can comfort my Constanze, if
you don't stay here?" In her account of his last moments, she says: "I
found Süssmayer sitting by Mozart's bed. The well-known 'Requiem' was
lying on the coverlet, and Mozart was explaining to Süssmayer the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page315" name="page315"></a>(p. 315)</span> mode in which he wished him to complete it after his death.
He further requested his wife to keep his death secret until she had
informed Albrechtsberger of it, 'for the situation of assistant organist
at the Stephen Church ought to be his before God and the world.' The
doctor came and ordered cold applications on Mozart's burning head....
The last movement of his lips was an endeavor to indicate where the
kettledrums should be used in the 'Requiem.' I think I still hear the
sound."<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>



<h3>HAYDN<br>

By <span class="smcap">C. E. Bourne</span><br>

(1732-1809)</h3>

<a id="img035" name="img035"></a>
<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img035.jpg" width="200" height="276" alt="Haydn." title="">
</div>

<p>No composer has ever given greater or purer pleasure by his compositions
than is given by "papa" Haydn; there is an unceasing flow of
cheerfulness and lively tone in his music, even in the most solemn
pieces, as in his Masses, the predominant feeling is that of gladness;
as he once said to Carpani: "At the thought of God my heart leaps for
joy, and I cannot help my music doing the same." But it is not alone as
the writer of graceful and beautiful music that Haydn has a claim on our
remembrance; he has been truly called the "father of the symphony."
Mozart once said: "It was from Haydn that I first learned the true way
to compose quartettes;" and "The Creation," which must ever be counted
one of the masterpieces of oratorio music, was his work.</p>

<p>His family were of the people, his father being a master wheelwright at
Rohrau, a small Austrian village on the borders of Lower Austria and
Hungary and his mother having been employed as a cook in the castle of
Count Harrach, the principal lord of the district. Joseph Haydn was born
on March 31, 1732 the second child of his parents; and as ten brothers
and sisters afterward came into the world, it can easily be understood
that his lot was not a very luxurious one. His parents were simple,
honest people of the laboring class, very ignorant, but, like most
German peasants, with a certain love for and facility in music, not
quite so common in this country. Haydn's father had a good voice, and
could sing well, accompanying himself on the harp, though he did not
know a single note of written music. Then there was the village
schoolmaster, who could actually play the violin, and whom little
Joseph watched with wondering eyes, extracting <span class="pagenum"><a id="page316" name="page316"></a>(p. 316)</span> those
marvellously sweet sounds from his wooden instrument, until, with the
child's spirit of imitation, as his parents sang their "Volkslieder,"
the little fellow, perched on a stone bench, gravely handled two pieces
of wood of his own as if they were bow and fiddle, keeping exact time,
and flourishing the bow in the approved fashion of the schoolmaster.
From this very little incident came an important change in his life; for
a relation, Johann Mathias Frankh, of Hainburg, happened to be present
on one occasion, and, thinking he saw an aptitude for music in the boy,
offered to take him into his own school at Hainburg, where accordingly
young Haydn went at the age of six years.</p>

<p>There he remained for two years, making rapid progress in singing and in
playing all sorts of instruments, among others the clavier, violin,
organ, and drum. He said afterward, with the unaffected piety, far
removed from cant, that was characteristic of him: "Almighty God, to
whom I render thanks for all his unnumbered mercies, gave me such
facility in music that, by the time I was six years old, I stood up like
a man and sang masses in the church choir, and could play a little on
the clavier and violin." Of Frankh, a very strict, but thorough and most
painstaking teacher, he also said afterward: "I shall be grateful to
that man as long as I live for keeping me so hard at work, though I used
to get more flogging than food;" and in Haydn's will he remembered
Frankh's family, leaving his daughter a sum of money and a portrait of
Frankh himself, "my first instructor in music."</p>

<p>For some years he seems to have lived a miserable, struggling life,
giving lessons, playing the organ in churches, and studying when and
where he could. He had a few pupils at the moderate remuneration of two
florins a month, and he had contrived to obtain possession of an old
worm-eaten clavier, on which he used diligently to practise in the
garret in the Kohlmarkt, where he lived. A pitiable description is given
of the lodging he then occupied. It was on the sixth story, in a room
without stove or window. In winter his breath froze on his thin
coverlet, and the water, that in the morning he had to fetch himself
from the spring for washing, was frequently changed into a lump of ice
before his arrival in that elevated region. Life was indeed hard; but he
was constantly at work, and, having made a precious "find" on an old
bookstall one day of Fux's "Gradus ad Parnassum," in a very dilapidated
condition, but very cheap, he was ardently preparing himself for the
life&mdash;he now vowed should be his&mdash;of a composer.</p>

<p>About this time Haydn received a commission from Felix Kurz, a comic
actor of the Stadt-Theatre, to put a farce of his, "Der neue krumme
Teufel," to music. This farce, of which the words still remain, though
the music has been lost, was very successful, and was played in Vienna,
Prague, Berlin, and a number of other towns. The well-known story of
Haydn's "Tempest Music" is connected with this. In one part of this
piece a terrible storm was supposed to be raging, and the accompanying
music must of course be suitably descriptive; but the difficulty was
that Haydn had never seen the sea: therefore had not the slightest
notion of what a storm at sea was like. Kurz tries to describe the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page317" name="page317"></a>(p. 317)</span> waves running mountains high, the pitching and tossing, the
roll of thunder, and the howling of the wind; and Haydn produces all
sorts of ugly, jerky, and noisy music, but none of it is in the remotest
degree like a storm at sea, or anywhere else. At last, after Kurz had
become hoarse with his nautical disquisitions, and Haydn's fingers were
tired of scrambling all over the piano, the little musician in a rage
crashed his hands down on the two extremes of the instrument,
exclaiming: "Let's have done with this tempest!"</p>

<p>"Why, that's it; that's the very thing!" shouted the clown, jumping up
and embracing him; and with this crash and a run of semitones to the
centre of the piano this troublesome tempest was most satisfactorily
represented.</p>

<p>When, many years afterward, Haydn was crossing the Straits of Dover to
England, amid his sufferings he could not help laughing at the ludicrous
recollections of this early experience of his.</p>

<p>Things still went on improving, and Haydn, who was always lucky in the
patrons he secured (at least according to the notion about patrons that
then prevailed), was invited to the country-house of Herr von Fürnberg,
a wealthy amateur, to stay there and compose quartettes for him&mdash;a style
of music for which von Fürnberg had an especial liking. To his prompting
it is that we owe the lovely series of quartettes which Haydn
wrote&mdash;still as fresh and full of serene beauty as when first tried over
by the virtuosi of Weinzirl. The next piece of good fortune was Haydn's
appointment as director of the band and composer to Count Ferdinand
Morzin at Lukaver near Pilsen; and here, in 1759, his first symphony was
written. His salary was very small, only 200 florins a year (or £20),
with board and lodgings; but on the strength of it he unfortunately
determined on the serious step of embarking in matrimony. A barber,
named Keller, is said to have been very kind to him in the days of his
poverty, and out of gratitude Haydn gave music-lessons to his daughters.
One of them, the youngest, was very pretty, and Haydn fell in love with
her. But she became a nun; and the father then prevailed upon Haydn to
marry the elder one, who was three years older than he&mdash;a sour-tempered,
bigoted, and abominably selfish woman, who contributed little to the
happiness of his life, and was always bringing priests and friars to the
house and worrying her good-tempered husband to compose masses and other
church music for these men.</p>

<p>Count Morzin was compelled to give up his band in 1761; but Haydn did
not remain long without employment, as Prince Esterhazy, who had heard
his symphonies at Morzin's house, engaged him to assist Werner, his
Capellmeister. As director of Prince Esterhazy's band, Haydn was fated
to remain for many years living at Esterház, the prince's country-seat,
composing there nearly all his operas and songs, and many of his
symphonies.</p>

<p>In 1785 Haydn received a commission which showed the wide reputation he
had then gained. The Chapter of Cadiz Cathedral requested him to write
some instrumental music for performance on Good Friday. "The Seven Words
of our Saviour on the Cross" was in consequence written by him.</p>

<p>Several invitations had been sent from England for Haydn to pay a visit
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page318" name="page318"></a>(p. 318)</span> there; but it was only after Prince Esterhazy was dead that he
was prevailed on by Salomon to cross the sea. A characteristic
conversation between him and Mozart&mdash;which took place before he
undertook this, in those days, really formidable journey&mdash;is recorded.</p>

<p>"Papa," said Mozart, "you have no training for the great world, and you
speak too few languages."</p>

<p>Haydn replied: "My language is understood by all the world."</p>

<p>He set out on December 15, 1790, and did not return to Vienna till July,
1792. In London, where he wrote and conducted a number of symphonies for
Salomon, he was the "lion" of the season, being in constant request for
conducting concerts and paying visits to the nobility. Of these
symphonies Salomon once said to him: "I am strongly of opinion that you
never will surpass this music."</p>

<p>"I never mean to try," was the answer.</p>

<p>But this must not be taken to mean that Haydn had given up striving
after the truest perfection in his art, and it probably meant no more
than that for the time he was satisfied with his work. Far more like the
genuine expression of the feeling of the great artist was his utterance,
just before he died, to Kalkbrenner: "I have only just learned in my old
age how to use the wind-instruments; and now that I do understand them,
I must leave the world."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img036.jpg" width="600" height="420" alt="" title="">
<p>Haydn composing his "Creation."</p>
</div>

<p>Great as the work accomplished in his youth and early manhood
unquestionably was, it remained for his old age to accomplish his
greatest work, and that by which he is best known&mdash;the oratorio of "The
Creation." It is said that the first ideas for this came to him when, in
crossing the English Channel, he encountered a terrific storm. Soon
after his leaving London, where the words had been given him by Salomon,
Haydn set about composing the music. "Never," he says, "was I so pious
as when composing 'The Creation.' I knelt down every day and prayed God
to strengthen me for my work." It was first produced on March 31, 1799,
his 67th birthday, at the National Theatre, Vienna, and was at once
accorded an extraordinary share of popular favor. There is a pathetic
story of the last performance of the work, at which Haydn, in extreme
old age, in 1808, was present, when Salieri conducted. He was carried in
an arm-chair into the hall, and received there with the warmest greeting
by the audience. At the sublime passage, "And there was light!" Haydn,
quite overcome, raised his hand, pointing upward and saying, "It came
from thence." Soon after this his agitation increased so much that it
was thought better to take him home at the end of the first part. The
people crowded round him to take leave, and Beethoven is said to have
reverently kissed his hand and forehead. After composing "The Creation,"
Haydn was prevailed upon to write another work, of somewhat similar
character, to words adapted from Thomson's poem, and entitled "The
Seasons." This, though containing some fine descriptive music and
several choruses of great beauty, is not at all equal to the earlier
work, though at the time its success was quite as complete. But the
exertion of writing two such great works, almost without rest between
them, was too great, and he himself <span class="pagenum"><a id="page319" name="page319"></a>(p. 319)</span> said: "'The Seasons' gave
me the finishing stroke." The bombardment of Vienna by the French in
1809 greatly disturbed the poor old man. He still retained some of his
old humor, and during the thunder of the cannons called out to his
servants: "Children, don't be frightened; no harm can happen to you
while Haydn is by!" He was now no longer able to compose, and to his
last unfinished quartette he added a few bars of "Der Greis," as a
conclusion:</p>

<p class="poem30">
<span class="min03em">"</span>Hin ist alle meine Kraft:<br>
  Alt und schwach bin ich.</p>

<p class="poem50">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Joseph Haydn</span>."</p>

<p>"Gone is all my strength: old and weak am I." And these lines he caused
to be engraved, and sent on a card to the friends who visited him. The
end was indeed now near. On May 26, 1809, he had his servants gathered
round him for the last adieus; then, by his desire, he was carried to
the piano, where he played three times over the "Emperor's Hymn,"
composed by him. Then he was taken to his bed, where five days afterward
he died.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h3>BEETHOVEN<br>

By <span class="smcap">C. E. Bourne</span><br>

(1770-1827)</h3>

<a id="img037" name="img037"></a>
<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img037.jpg" width="200" height="257" alt="Beethoven." title="">
</div>

<p>In one of his letters to Frau von Streicher, at Baden, Beethoven writes:
"When you visit the ancient ruins, do not forget that Beethoven has
often lingered there; when you stray through the silent pine-forests, do
not forget that Beethoven often wrote poetry there, or, as it is termed,
composed." He was always fond of claiming the title "Ton-dichter, poet
in music;" and surely of all the great geniuses who have walked the
earth, to none can the glorious name of "poet" more truly be given than
to Ludwig von Beethoven.</p>

<p>He was born at Bonn, on December 17, 1770. His father, Johann von
Beethoven, was a tenor singer in the Electoral Chapel of the Archbishop
of Cologne, at Bonn, and his mother, Maria Magdalena, was a daughter of
the head cook at the castle of Ehrenbreitstein. The Beethoven family
originally came from Louvain, in Belgium; but the composer's grandfather
had settled in Bonn, first as a singer, and afterward as Capellmeister
to the court. Musicians were not held of much account in those days,
and the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page320" name="page320"></a>(p. 320)</span> marriage of a singer with the daughter of a cook was
not at all considered a mésalliance. Johann was a sad drunken
scapegrace, and his poor wife, in bringing up her family upon the small
portion of his earnings which she could save from being squandered at
the tavern, had a pitiably hard and long struggling life of it.</p>

<p>Johann soon discovered the extraordinary musical endowments of his child
and at once set to work to make a "prodigy" of him, as Handel, Bach, and
Mozart had been before; for in this way the father hoped to secure a
mine of wealth and lazy competence for himself. So the boy, when only a
few years old, was kept for long weary hours practising the piano, and
one of the earliest stories of his life is of the five-year-old little
child made to stand on a bench before the piano laboring over the notes,
while the tears flowed fast down his cheeks at the cold and aching pain,
from which his hard taskmaster would not release him. Besides his
father, a clever musician who lodged in the house, Pfeiffer, an oboist
at the theatre, gave him lessons. Beethoven used afterward to say that
he had learnt more from this Pfeiffer than from any one else; but he was
too ready to abet the father in his tyranny, and many a time, when the
two came reeling home late at night from drinking bouts at the tavern,
they would arouse the little fellow from his sleep and set him to work
at the piano till daybreak.</p>

<p>His next instructor was Neefe, the organist of the Archbishop's private
chapel, a really skilful and learned musician, who predicted that the
boy would become a second Mozart. Under him Beethoven studied for
several years, and in 1782, when he was hardly twelve years old, we find
him acting as organist in Neefe's place during the absence of the latter
on a journey. The next year three sonatas composed by young Beethoven,
and dedicated to the Elector in fulsome language, which was probably his
father's production, were printed. Soon afterward the boy obtained the
appointment of assistant-organist to the Elector, with a salary of a
hundred thalers, no inconsiderable addition to the resources of his poor
mother, who, with her family of three children, Ludwig, Carl, and
Johann, and the more and more frequent visits of her ne'er-do-well of a
husband to the tavern, was often grievously hard put to it for money.
Young Ludwig had little play time in his life, and little opportunity
for education; but amid his hard work some indications of a mischievous
boyish spirit are to be found.</p>

<p>In the year 1791, the Elector, as head of the Teutonic Order, had to be
present at a grand conclave at Mergentheim, and thither he resolved to
take his musical and theatrical staff. Two ships were chartered to
convey these gentlemen down the Rhine and Maine, and a very pleasant
excursion, with all sorts of frolics and high revellings, they had of
it. Lux, a celebrated actor, was chosen king of the expedition, and we
find Beethoven figuring among the scullions.</p>

<p>In the autumn of the year following, a visit was paid by Haydn to Bonn
on his return from his second journey to London. The musicians of the
town gave a breakfast at Godesberg in his honor, and here Beethoven
summoned up courage to show the veteran musician a cantata which he had
recently composed. This was warmly praised by Haydn, and probably about
this time arrangements were made for Beethoven to be received as a
pupil by the older master. It is <span class="pagenum"><a id="page321" name="page321"></a>(p. 321)</span> in this period that we must
place a well-known anecdote. The young musician, already famous in his
own neighborhood, was composing, as his custom was, in the wood outside
the city, when a funeral cortége passed him. The priest, seeing him,
instantly checked the dirge which was being chanted, and the procession
passed in solemn silence, "for fear of disturbing him." In the beginning
of November, 1792, the young musician left Bonn for Vienna, and, as it
happened, he never afterward returned to the familiar scenes of his
birthplace.</p>

<p>Beethoven was never a very easy man to get on with, and his intercourse
with Haydn, who used to call him the "Great Mogul," does not seem to
have been the most friendly. He was dissatisfied with the instruction
given him, and suspicions were awakened in his mind that the elder
musician was jealous of him, and did not wish him to improve. These
thoughts were strengthened by the result of a chance meeting one day, as
he was walking home with his portfolio under his arm, with Johann
Schenk, a scientific and thoroughly accomplished musician. Beethoven
complained to him of the little advance he was making in counterpoint,
and that Haydn never corrected his exercises or taught him anything.
Schenk asked to look through the portfolio, and see the last work that
Haydn had revised, and on examining it he was astonished to find a
number of mistakes that had not been pointed out. It is difficult to
understand Haydn's conduct in this matter, for the perfidious treatment
suspected by Beethoven is quite at variance with the ordinarily accepted
character of the old man, and I cannot help fancying that the only
foundation for Beethoven's suspicion was that Haydn did not quite
understand the erratic genius of the youth till some time afterward.
Beethoven dedicated his three pianoforte sonatas, Op. II., to Haydn, and
when the latter suggested that he should add on the title page "Pupil of
Haydn," the "Great Mogul" refused, bluntly saying "that he had never
learnt anything from him." After Haydn, Albrechtsberger and Salieri were
for a time his teachers, but Beethoven got on no better with them, and
Albrechtsberger said, "Have nothing to do with him; he has learnt
nothing, and will never do anything in decent style." Perhaps not in
your pedant's style, O great contrapuntist!</p>

<p>Beethoven cannot be said to have been unfortunate in his friends. He had
many true and faithful ones throughout his life, and though he suffered
from pecuniary troubles, caused by the conduct of his brothers, he was
never in such a state of grinding poverty as some other artists, such as
Schubert, have been&mdash;never compelled to waste precious years of his life
in producing "pot-boilers"&mdash;working not for art so much as for mere food
and shelter. In 1794 Prince Karl Lichnowski, who had been a pupil of
Mozart, and who, as well as his wife Christiane, was <i>fanatico per la
musica</i>, proposed that Beethoven should come and live at his palace.
They had no children; a suite of rooms was placed at the musician's
disposal; no terms were proposed; the offer was the most delicate and
friendly imaginable, and was accepted by Beethoven in the spirit in
which it was made. For ten years he resided with the Lichnowskis, and
these were probably the years of purest happiness in the great
composer's life, although early in their <span class="pagenum"><a id="page322" name="page322"></a>(p. 322)</span> course the terrible
affliction of deafness began to be felt by him. He at this time freely
frequented the salons of the Viennese nobility, many of whom were
accomplished virtuosi themselves, and were able to appreciate the great
genius of the new-comer, rough and bearish as oftentimes he must have
appeared to them&mdash;a great contrast to the courtly Haydn and Salieri, who
might be seen sitting side by side on the sofa in some grandee's
music-room, with their swords, wigs, ruffles, silk stockings, and
snuff-boxes, while the insignificant-looking and meanly dressed
Beethoven used to stand unnoticed in a corner. Here is a description of
his appearance given by a Frau von Bernhard: "When he visited us, he
generally put his head in at the door before entering, to see if there
were any one present he did not like. He was short and
insignificant-looking, with a red face covered with pock-marks. His hair
was quite dark. His dress was very common, quite a contrast to the
elegant attire customary in those days, especially in our circles.... He
was very proud, and I have known him refuse to play, even when Countess
Thun, the mother of Princess Lichnowski, had fallen on her knees before
him as he lay on the sofa to beg him to. The Countess was a very
eccentric person.... At the Lichnowskis' I saw Haydn and Salieri, who
were then very famous, while Beethoven excited no interest."</p>

<p>It was in the year 1800 that Beethoven at last was compelled to
acknowledge to himself the terrible calamity of almost total deafness
that had befallen him. He writes to his friend Wegeler, "If I had not
read somewhere that man must not of his own free will depart this life,
I should long ere this have been no more and that through my own act....
What is to be the result of this the good God alone knows. I beg of you
not to mention my state to any one, not even to Lorchen [Wegeler's
wife]. But," he continues, "I live only in my music, and no sooner is
one thing completed than another is begun. In fact, as at present, I am
often engaged on three or four compositions at one time."</p>

<p>An Anecdote about Beethoven.</p>
</div>

<p>But at first all was not gloom; for Beethoven was in love&mdash;not the love
of fleeting fancy that, like other poets, he may have experienced
before, but deeply, tragically, in love; and it seems that, for a time
at least, this love was returned. The lady was the Countess Julia
Guicciardi; but his dream did not last long, for in the year 1801 she
married a Count Gallenberg. Hardly anything is known of this love affair
of Beethoven's. A few letters full of passionate tenderness, and with a
certain very pathetic simple trustfulness in her love running through
them all&mdash;on which her marriage shortly afterward is a strange comment;
the "Moonlight Sonata," vibrating, as it is throughout, with a lover's
supremest ecstasy of devotion, these are the only records of that one
blissful epoch in the poor composer's life; but how much it affected his
after life, how it mingled in the dreams from which his loveliest
creations of later years arose, it is impossible now to say. In a letter
to Wegeler, dated November 16, 1801, he says, "You can hardly realize
what a miserable, desolate life mine has been for the last two years; my
defective hearing everywhere pursuing me like a spectre, making me fly
from every one, and appear a misanthrope; and yet no one in reality is
less so! This change [to a happier life] has been brought about by a
lovely and fascinating <span class="pagenum"><a id="page323" name="page323"></a>(p. 323)</span> girl who loves me and whom I love.
After the lapse of two years I have again enjoyed some blissful moments,
and now for the first time I feel that marriage can bestow happiness;
but alas! she is not in the same rank of life as myself.... You shall
see me as happy as I am destined to be here below, but not unhappy. No,
that I could not bear. I will grasp Fate by the throat; it shall not
utterly crush me. Oh, it is so glorious to live one's life a thousand
times!" No misanthropy this, surely; he could not always speak the
speech of common men, or care for the tawdry bravery of titles or fine
clothes in which they strutted, but what a heart there was in the man,
what a wondrous insight into all the beauty of the world, visible and
invisible, around him! The most glorious lovesong ever composed,
"Adelaide," was written by him; but Julia Guicciardi preferred a Count
Gallenberg, keeper of the royal archives in Vienna, and Beethoven, to
the end of his days, went on his way alone.</p>

<p>It was at this time that he composed his oratorio, "The Mount of
Olives," which can hardly be reckoned among his finest works; and his
one opera&mdash;but such an opera&mdash;"Fidelio." The greater part of these works
was composed during his stay, in the summer months, at Hetzendorf, a
pretty, secluded little village near Schönbrunn. He spent his days
wandering alone through the quiet, shady alleys of the imperial park
there, and his favorite seat was between two boughs of a venerable oak,
at a height of about two feet from the ground. For some time he had
apartments at a residence of Baron Pronay's, near this village; but he
suddenly left, "because the baron would persist in making him profound
bows every time that he met him." Like a true poet, he delighted in the
country. "No man on earth," he writes, "loves the country more. Woods,
trees, and rock give the response which man requires. Every tree seems
to say, 'Holy, holy.'"</p>

<p>In 1804 the magnificent "Eroica" symphony was completed. This had
originally been commenced in honor of Napoleon Bonaparte, then First
Consul, who, Beethoven&mdash;throughout his life an ardent Republican&mdash;then
believed was about to bring liberty to all the nations of Europe. When
the news of the empire came the dream departed, and Beethoven, in a
passionate rage, tore the title page of the symphony in two, and, with a
torrent of imprecations against the tyrant, stamped on the torn
fragments.</p>

<p>"My hero&mdash;a tyrant!" he shrieked, as he trampled on the poor page. On
this page the inscription had been simply, "Bonaparte&mdash;Luigi v.
Beethoven". For some years he refused to publish the work, and, when at
last this was done, the inscription read as follows: "Sinfonia Eroica
per festigiari il sovvenire d'un grand' uomo" (Heroic symphony, to
celebrate the memory of a great man). When Napoleon died, in 1821,
Beethoven said, "Seventeen years before I composed the music for this
occasion;" and surely no grander music than that of the "Funeral March"
was ever composed for the obsequies of a fallen hero. This is not the
place to enter into a description of the marvellous succession of
colossal works&mdash;symphonies, concertos, sonatas, trios, quartets, etc.,
culminating in the "Choral Symphony," his ninth, and last&mdash;which,
through those long years of a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page324" name="page324"></a>(p. 324)</span> silent life, imprisoned within
himself, the great master put forth. His deafness prevented his
appearing in public to conduct, although, with the natural desire of a
composer to be present at the production of his own work, he long
struggled to take his part in the first performances of symphonies and
concertos.</p>

<p>When the great choral symphony was first performed he attempted to
conduct, but in reality another conductor was stationed near him to give
the right time to the band. After the majestic instrumental movements
had been played came the final one, concluding with Schiller's "Hymn to
Joy." The chorus breaks forth, thundering out in concert with all the
instruments. At the words "Seid umschlunger, Millionen," the audience
could no longer restrain their excited delight, and burst into
tremendous applause, drowning the voices of singers and the sounds of
strings and brass. The last notes are heard, but still Beethoven stands
there absorbed in thought&mdash;he does not know that the music is ended.
This was the first time that the people realized the full deprivation of
hearing from which he suffered. Fraulein Unger, the soprano, gently
takes his arm and turns him round to front the acclaiming multitude.
There are few in that crowd who, while they cheer, do not feel the tears
stealing down their cheeks at the sight of the poor lonely man who, from
the prison-house of his affliction, has brought to them the gladness of
thought so divine. Unmoved, he bowed his acknowledgment, and quietly
left the building.</p>

<p>His later years were embittered with troubles about his nephew Carl, a
youth to whom he was fondly attached, but who shamefully repaid the love
of the desolate old man. Letters like the following, to the teacher in
whose house the boy lived, show the constant thought and affection given
to this boy: "Your estimable lady is politely requested to let the
undersigned know as soon as possible (that I may not be obliged to keep
it all in my head) how many pairs of stockings, trousers, shoes, and
drawers are required, and how many yards of kerseymere to make a pair of
black trousers for my tall nephew."</p>

<p>His death was the result of a cold which produced inflammation of the
lungs. On the morning of March 24, 1827, he took the sacrament and when
the clergyman was gone and his friends stood round his bed, he muttered.
"<i>Plaudite amici, comedia finita est.</i>" He then fell into an agony so
intense that he could no longer articulate, and thus continued until the
evening of the 26th. A violent thunder-storm arose; one of his friends,
watching by his bedside when the thunder was rolling and a vivid flash
of lightning lit up the room, saw him suddenly open his eyes, lift his
right hand upward for some seconds&mdash;as if in defiance of the powers of
evil&mdash;with clenched fist and a stern, solemn expression on his face;
and then he sank back and died.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

(1784-1840)</h3>

</div>

<p>Nicolo Paganini, whose European fame as a violinist entitles him to a
notice here, was born at Genoa in 1784. His father, a commission-broker,
played on the mandolin; but fully aware of the inferiority of an
instrument so limited in power, he put a violin into his son's hands,
and initiated him in the principles of music. The child succeeded so
well under parental tuition, that at eight years of age he played three
times a week in the church, as well as in the public saloons. At the
same period he composed a sonata. In his ninth year he was placed under
the instruction of Costa, first violoncellist of Genoa; then had lessons
of Rolla, a famous performer and composer; and finally studied
counterpoint at Parma under Ghiretti and the celebrated maestro Paer. He
now took an engagement at Lucca, where he chiefly associated with
persons who at the gaming-table stripped him of his gains as quickly as
he acquired them. He there received the appointment of director of
orchestra to the court, at which the Princess Elisa Bacciochi, sister of
Napoleon I., presided, and thither invited, to the full extent of her
means, superior talent of every kind. In 1813 he performed at Milan;
five years after, at Turin; and subsequently at Florence and Naples. In
1828 he visited Vienna, where a very popular violinist and composer,
Mayseder, asked him how he produced such new effects. His reply was
characteristic of a selfish mind: "<i>Chacun a ses secrets</i>" In that
capital, it is affirmed, he was imprisoned, being accused of having
murdered his wife. He challenged proofs of his ever having been married,
which could not be produced. Then he was charged with having poignarded
his mistress. This he also publicly refuted. The fact is that he knew
better how to make money than friends, and he raised up enemies wherever
his thirst for gold led him. Avarice was his master-passion; and, second
to this, gross sensuality.</p>

<p>The year 1831 found Paganini in Paris, in which excitable capital he
produced a sensation not inferior to that created by the visit of
Rossini. Even this renowned composer was so carried away, either by the
actual genius of the violinist or by the current of popular enthusiasm,
that he is said to have wept on hearing Paganini for the first time. He
arrived in England in 1831, and immediately announced a concert at the
Italian Opera House, at a price which, if acceded to, would have yielded
£3,391 per night; but the attempt was too audacious, and he was
compelled to abate his demands, though he succeeded in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page326" name="page326"></a>(p. 326)</span> drawing
audiences fifteen nights in that season at the ordinary high prices of
the King's Theatre. He also gave concerts in other parts of London, and
performed at benefits, always taking at these a large proportion of the
proceeds. He visited most of the great towns, where his good fortune
still attended him. He was asked to play at the Commemoration Festival
at Oxford, in 1834, and demanded 1,000 guineas for his assistance at
three concerts. His terms were of course rejected.</p>

<p>Paganini died at Nice, in 1840, of a diseased larynx ("phthisie
laryngée"). By his will, dated 1837, he gave his two sisters legacies of
60,000 and 70,000 francs; his mother a pension of 1,200; the mother of
his son Achillino (a Jewess of Milan) a similar pension; and the rest of
his fortune, amounting to 4,000,000 francs, devolved on his son. These
and other facts before related, we give on the authority of the
"Biographie Universelle."</p>

<p>Paganini certainly was a man of genius and a great performer, but
sacrificed his art to his avarice. His mastery over the violin was
almost marvellous, though he made an ignoble use of his power by
employing it to captivate the mob of pretended amateurs by feats little
better than sleight-of-hand. His performance on a single string, and the
perfection of his harmonics, were very extraordinary; but why, as was
asked at the time, be confined to one string when there are four at
command that would answer every musical purpose so much better? His tone
was pure, though not strong, his strings having been of smaller diameter
than usual, to enable him to strain them at pleasure; for he tuned his
instrument most capriciously. He could be a very expressive player; we
have heard him produce effects deeply pathetic. His arpeggios evinced
his knowledge of harmony, and some of his compositions exhibit many
original and beautiful traits.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<h3>MENDELSSOHN<br>

By <span class="smcap">C. E. Bourne</span><br>

(1809-1847)</h3>


<p>Mendelssohn's lot in life was strikingly different from that of all the
musicians of whom I have hitherto written; he never knew, like Schubert,
what grinding poverty was, or suffered the long worries that Mozart had
to endure for lack of money. His father was a Jewish banker in Berlin,
the son of Moses Mendelssohn, a philosopher whose writings had already
made the name celebrated throughout Europe. The composer's father used
to say, with a very natural pride, after his own son had grown up,
"Formerly I was the son of my father, and now I am the father of my
son!"</p>

<p>Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy was born on February 3, 1809. His parents
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page327" name="page327"></a>(p. 327)</span> were neither of them trained musicians, though both
appreciated and loved music, and it was from his mother that young Felix
received his first music-lessons. When he had made some advance, Ludwig
Berger became his tutor for the piano, and Zelter, a very learned and
severe theorist, for counterpoint. At the age of nine years Felix had
attained such proficiency that we find him taking the pianoforte part in
a trio at a public concert of a Herr Gugel's, and when twelve years old
he began to compose, and actually wrote a trio, some sonatas, a cantata,
and several organ pieces. His home life was in the highest degree
favorable to his musical development. On alternate Sundays musical
performances were regularly given with a small orchestra in the large
dining-room, Felix or his sister Fanny, who also possessed remarkable
musical gifts, taking the pianoforte part, and new compositions by Felix
were always included in the programme. Many friends, musicians and
others, used to be present, Zelter regularly among their number, and the
pieces were always freely commented on, Felix receiving then, as indeed
he did all his life, the criticisms expressed, with the utmost
good-natured readiness.</p>

<a id="img041" name="img041"></a>
<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img041.jpg" width="200" height="233" alt="Mendelssohn." title="">
</div>

<p>In 1824 Moscheles, at that time a celebrated pianist, and residing in
London, visited Berlin, and was asked to give Felix music-lessons. This
is the testimony of Moscheles, an excellent and kind-hearted man, and a
thoroughly skilled musician, after spending nearly every day for six
weeks with the family: "It is a family such as I have never known
before; Felix, a mature artist, and yet but fifteen; Fanny,
extraordinarily gifted, playing Bach's fugues by heart and with
astonishing correctness&mdash;in fact, a thorough musician. The parents give
me the impression of people of the highest cultivation;" and on the
subject of lessons he says: "Felix has no need of lessons; if he wishes
to take a hint from me as to anything new, he can easily do so." But it
is very pleasant to find Mendelssohn afterward referring to these
lessons as having urged him on to enthusiasm, and, in the days in London
when his own fame had far outstripped that of the older musician,
acknowledging himself as "Moscheles's pupil." The elder Mendelssohn was
by no means carried away by the applause which the boy's playing and
compositions had gained, and in 1825 he took his son to Paris to obtain
Cherubini's opinion as to his musical abilities, with a view to the
choice of a profession; for he had by no means made up his mind that
Felix should spend his whole life as a musician. However, the surly old
Florentine, who was not always civil or appreciative of budding genius
(<i>teste</i> Berlioz), gave a decidedly favorable judgment on the
compositions submitted to him, and urged the father to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page328" name="page328"></a>(p. 328)</span> devote
his son to a musical career. And, indeed, on listening to the pieces
which were dated this year, especially a beautiful quartet in B minor,
an octet for strings, the music to an opera in two acts, "Camacho's
Wedding," and numerous pianoforte pieces, it is difficult to realize
that the composer was then only sixteen years of age, or that anyone
could question the artistic vocation that claimed him. But the next year
a work was written, the score of which is marked "Berlin, August 6,
1826," when it must be remembered that he was seventeen years of age,
which of itself was sufficient to rank him among the immortals&mdash;the
overture to the "Midsummer Night's Dream." Full of lovely imaginings,
with a wonderful fairy grace all its own, and a bewitching beauty,
revealing not only the soul of the true poet, but also the musician
profoundly skilled in all the art of orchestral effect, it is hard to
believe that it is the work of a boy under twenty, written in the bright
summer days of 1826, in his father's garden at Berlin.</p>

<p>Passing over the intermediate years with a simple reference to the
"Meeresstille," "Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage," which was then
composed, and a fine performance of Bach's "Passion Music," for which he
had been long drilling the members of the Berlin Singakademie, the next
event is a visit to England in 1829, where he was received with
extraordinary warmth, playing at the Philharmonic Concerts, conducting
his C minor Symphony, which he dedicated to the Philharmonic Society,
they in their turn electing him one of their honorary members; going to
dinners, balls, and the House of Commons, and enjoying himself most
hugely. His letters from England at this time are brimming over with fun
and graphic description; there is one especially amusing, in which he
describes himself with two friends going home from a late dinner at the
German Ambassador's, and on the way buying three German sausages, going
down a quiet street to devour them, with all the while joyous laughter
and snatches of part songs. There is also a little incident of this time
showing the wonderful memory he possessed. After a concert on "Midsummer
Night," when the "Midsummer Night's Dream" had very appropriately been
played, it was found that the score had been lost in a hackney-coach as
the party were returning to Mr. Attwood's. "Never mind," said
Mendelssohn, "I will make another," which he did, and on comparison with
the separate parts not a single difference was found in it.</p>

<p>At the beginning of December he was at home again, and that winter he
wrote the "Reformation Symphony," intended to be produced at the
tercentenary festival of the "Augsburg Confession" in the following
June. This symphony, with which Mendelssohn was not entirely satisfied,
was only once performed during his lifetime, but since his death it has
frequently been performed, and though not one of his most perfect works,
is recognized as a noble monument in honor of a great event. The next
spring he again set out on his travels, this time southward to Italy.</p>

<p>In 1833 Mendelssohn accepted an official post offered him by the
authorities of Düsseldorf, by which the entire musical arrangements of
the town, church, theatre, and singing societies were put under his
care. Immermann, the celebrated <span class="pagenum"><a id="page329" name="page329"></a>(p. 329)</span> poet, being associated with him
in the direction of the theatre. Things, however, did not go on very
smoothly there. Mendelssohn found all the many worries of theatrical
management&mdash;the engagement of singers and musicians, the dissensions to
be arranged, the many tastes to be conciliated&mdash;too irksome, and he did
not long retain this appointment; but the life among his friends at
Düsseldorf was most delightful, and the letters written at this time are
exceedingly lively and gay. It was here that he received the commission
from the Cæcilia-Verein of Frankfort for, and commenced, his grand
oratorio "St. Paul." The words for this, as also for the "Elijah" and
"Hymn of Praise" afterward, he selected himself with the help of his
friend Schubung, and they are entirely from the Bible&mdash;as he said, "The
Bible is always the best of all." Circumstances prevented the oratorio
being then produced at Frankfort, and the first public performance took
place at the Lower Rhine Festival at Düsseldorf, in May, 1836.</p>

<p>But his visits to Frankfort had a very important result in another way.
Mendelssohn there met Mademoiselle Cécile Jeanrenaud, the daughter of a
pastor of the French Reformed Church, and, though he had frequently
indulged in the admiration of beautiful and clever women&mdash;which is
allowable, and indeed an absolute necessity for a poet!&mdash;now for the
first time he fell furiously in plain unmistakable and downright love.
But it is more characteristic of the staid Teuton than the impulsive
musician, that before plighting his troth to her he went away for a
month's bathing at Scheveningen, in Holland, for the purpose of testing
the strength of his affection by this absence. On his return, finding
his amatory pulse still beating satisfactorily, he proposed to the young
lady, and, as it must be presumed that she had already made up her own
mind without any testing, he was accepted. On March 28, 1837, they were
married, and the wedded life that then began was one of pure, unclouded
happiness to the very end. Cécile Mendelssohn was a beautiful,
gentle-hearted, and loving wife, just the one to give a weary and
nervous artist in the home-life, with herself and the children near him,
the blessed solace of rest and calm that he so needed. It is thus that
Edward Devrient, the great German actor, and one of Mendelssohn's most
intimate friends, describes her: "Cécile was one of those sweet womanly
natures whose gentle simplicity, whose mere presence, soothed and
pleased. She was slight, with features of striking beauty and delicacy;
her hair was between brown and gold, but the transcendent lustre of her
great blue eyes, and the brilliant roses of her cheeks, were sad
harbingers of early death. She spoke little, and never with animation,
in a low, soft voice. Shakespeare's words, "My gracious silence,"
applied to her no less than to the wife of Coriolanus."</p>

<p>After giving up his official position at Düsseldorf, in 1835,
Mendelssohn was invited to become the conductor of the now famous
Gewandhaus concerts at Leipsic, a post which he gladly accepted, and
which, retained by him for many years, was to be one of the greatest
delights of his artistic life. Not only was he loved and appreciated in
Leipsic&mdash;far more than in Berlin, his own city&mdash;but he had here an
opportunity of assisting many composers and <i>virtuosi</i>, who otherwise
would have sought in vain for a hearing. Thus, after Liszt, when
visiting the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page330" name="page330"></a>(p. 330)</span> town, had been first of all received with great
coldness, owing to the usual prices of admission to the concerts having
been raised, Mendelssohn set everything straight by having a soirée in
his honor at the Gewandhaus, where there were three hundred and fifty
people, orchestra, chorus, punch, pastry, Meeresstille Psalm, Bach's
Triple Concerto, choruses from St. Paul, Fantasia on Lucia, the Erl
King, the Devil and his Grandmother, the latter probably a mild
satirical reference to Liszt's stormy and often incoherent playing. It
is also pleasant to find how cordially Mendelssohn received Berlioz
there, as told in the "Memoirs" of the latter, spending ungrudgingly
long days in aiding in rehearsals for his "Romeo et Juliette," though
Mendelssohn never sympathized much with Berlioz's eccentric muse.</p>

<p>The "Lobgesang," or "Hymn of Praise," a "symphonie-cantata," as he
called it, was his next great work, composed in 1840, together with
other music, at the request of the Leipsic Town-Council, for a festival
held in that town in commemoration of the invention of printing, on June
25th. None who have heard this work can forget the first impression
produced when the grand instrumental movements with which it commences
are merged in the majestic chorus, "All men, all things, praise ye the
Lord," or the intensely dramatic effect of the repeated tenor cry,
"Watchman, will the night soon pass?" answered at last by the clear
soprano message of glad tidings, "The night is departing, the day is at
hand!" This "watchman" episode was added some time afterward, and, as he
told a friend, was suggested to the composer during the weary hours of a
long sleepless night, when the words, "Will the night soon pass?" again
and again seemed to be repeated to him. But a greater work even than
this was now in progress; the "Elijah" had been begun.</p>

<p>In 1841 began a troublesome and harassing connection with Berlin, a city
where, except in his home life, Mendelssohn never seems to have been
very fortunate. At the urgent entreaty of the king, he went to reside
there as head of the new Musical Academy. But disagreements arose, and
he did not long take an active part in the management. The king,
however, was very anxious to retain his services, and a sort of general
office seems to have been created for him, the duties of which were to
supply music for any dramatic works which the king took it into his head
to have so embellished. And, though it is to this that we owe the noble
"Antigone," "&OElig;dipus," "Athalie," "Midsummer Night's Dream," and other
music, this work to dictation was very worrying, and one cannot think
without impatience of the annoyances to which he was subjected. The king
could not understand why he shrank from writing music to the choruses of
Æschylus's "Eumenides." Other composers would do it by the yard, why not
he?</p>

<p>Passing rapidly over the intervening years filled with busy work, both
in composition and as one of the principals of a newly started
Conservatorium in Leipsic, we come to 1846, when his great work "Elijah"
was at last completed and performed. On August 26th, at the Birmingham
Festival, the performance went splendidly. Staudigl took the part of the
prophet, and a young tenor, Lockey, sang the air, "Then shall the
righteous," in the last part, as Mendelssohn <span class="pagenum"><a id="page331" name="page331"></a>(p. 331)</span> says, "so very
beautifully, that I was obliged to collect myself to prevent my being
overcome, and to enable me to beat time steadily." Rarely, indeed, has a
composer so truly realized his own conception as Mendelssohn did in the
great tone-picture which he drew of the Prophet of Carmel and the
wilderness.</p>

<p>"I figured to myself," he says, "Elijah as a grand, mighty prophet, such
as might again reappear in our own day, energetic and zealous, stern,
wrathful, and gloomy, a striking contrast to the court myrmidons and
popular rabble&mdash;in fact, in opposition to the whole world, and yet borne
on angel's wings!" Nothing can be finer than this, with that exquisite
touch in the last words, "<i>in opposition to the whole world, and yet
borne on angel's wings</i>."</p>

<p>After returning to Germany he was soon busily employed in recasting some
portions of "Elijah" with which he was not satisfied; he had also
another oratorio on even a grander scale, "Christus," already commenced;
and at last, after all his life-long seeking in vain for a good libretto
for an opera, he had begun to set one written by Geibel, the German
poet, "Loreley," to music. But his friends now noticed how worn and
weary he used oftentimes to look, and how strangely irritable he
frequently was, and there can hardly be a doubt that some form of the
cerebral disease from which his father and several of his relations had
died, was already, deep-seated and obscure, disquieting him. The sudden
announcement of the death of his sister, Fanny Hensel, herself a musical
genius, to whom he was very fondly attached, on his return to Frankfort
from his last visit to England in May, 1847, terribly affected him. He
fell to the ground with a loud shriek, and it was long before he
recovered consciousness.</p>

<p>Indeed, it may be said that he never really recovered from this shock.
In the summer he went with his wife and children, and in company with
his brother Paul and his family, on a tour in Switzerland, where he
hoped that complete idleness as regards music, life in the open air,
sketching, and intercourse with chosen friends, might once more give
strength to his enfeebled nerves. And for a time the beauty of the
mountains and the lakes seemed to bring him rest, and again he began to
work at his oratorio "Christus;" but still his friends continued anxious
about him. He looked broken down and aged, a constant agitation seemed
to possess him, and the least thing would often strangely affect and
upset him.</p>

<p>In September he returned to Leipsic; he was then more cheerful, and able
to talk about music and to write, although he could not resume the
conductorship of the Gewandhaus concerts. He again had projects in view.
Jenny Lind was to sing in his "Elijah," at Vienna, whither he would go
and conduct, and he was about to publish some new songs. One day in
October he went to call upon his friend, Madame Frege, a gifted lady
who, he said, sang his songs better than anyone else, to consult her
about some new songs. She sang them over to him several times, and then,
as it was getting dark, she went out of the room for a few minutes to
order lights. When she returned he was lying on the sofa, shivering with
cold, and in agonizing pain. Leeches were applied, and he partially
recovered; but another attack followed, and this was the last.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

(1811-1886)</h3>

<p>Franz Liszt was born in 1811. He had the hot Hungarian blood of his
father, the fervid German spirit of his mother, and he inherited the
lofty independence, with none of the class prejudices, of the old
Hungarian nobility from which he sprang. Liszt's father, Adam, earned a
modest livelihood as agent and accountant in the house of Count
Esterhazy. In that great musical family, inseparably associated with the
names of Haydn and Schubert, Adam Liszt had frequent opportunities of
meeting distinguished musicians. The prince's private band had risen to
public fame under the instruction of the venerable Haydn himself. The
Liszts, father and son, often went to Eisenstadt, where the count lived;
there they rubbed elbows with Cherubini and Hummel, a pupil of Mozart.</p>

<p>Franz took to music from his earliest childhood. When about five years
old he was asked what he would like to do. "Learn the piano," said the
little fellow. Soon afterward his father asked him what he would like to
be; the child pointed to a print of Beethoven hanging on the wall, and
said, "Like him." Long before his feet could reach the pedals or his
fingers stretch an octave, the boy spent all his spare time strumming,
making what he called "clangs," chords and modulations. He mastered
scales and exercises without difficulty.</p>

<p>Czerny at once took to Liszt, but refused to take anything for his
instruction. Salieri was also fascinated, and instructed him in harmony;
and fortunate it was that Liszt began his course under two strict
mentors. He soon began to resent Czerny's method&mdash;thought he knew better
and needed not those dry studies of Clementi and that irksome fingering
by rule&mdash;he could finger anything in a half-a-dozen different ways.
There was a moment when it seemed that master and pupil would have to
part, but timely concessions to genius paved the way to dutiful
submission, and years afterward the great master dedicated to the rigid
disciplinarian of his boyhood his "Vingt-quatre Grandes Études" in
affectionate remembrance.</p>

<p>Such a light as Liszt's could not be long hid; all Vienna, in 1822, was
talking of the wonderful boy. "<i>Est deus in nobis</i>," wrote the papers,
profanely. The "little Hercules," the "young giant," the boy "virtuoso
from the clouds," were among the epithets coined to celebrate his
marvellous renderings of Hummel's "Concerto in A," and a free "Fantasia"
of his own. The Vienna Concert Hall was crowded to hear him, and the
other illustrious artists&mdash;then, as <span class="pagenum"><a id="page333" name="page333"></a>(p. 333)</span> indeed they have been ever
since forced to do wherever Liszt appeared&mdash;effaced themselves with as
good a grace as they could.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable tribute to the generous nature as well as to the
consummate ability of Liszt, that, while opposing partisans have fought
bitterly over him&mdash;Thalbergites, Herzites, Mendelssohnites <i>versus</i>
Lisztites&mdash;yet few of the great artists who have, one after another, had
to yield to him in popularity have denied to him their admiration, while
most of them have given him their friendship.</p>

<p>Liszt early wooed, and early won Vienna. He spoke ever of his dear
Viennese, and their resounding city. A concert tour on his way to Paris
brought him before the critical public of Stuttgart and Munich. Hummel,
an old man, and Moscheles, then in his prime, heard him and declared
that his playing was equal to theirs. But Liszt was bent upon completing
his studies in the celebrated school of the French capital, and at the
feet of the old musical dictator, Cherubini. The Erards, who were
destined to owe so much to Liszt, and to whom Liszt throughout his
career owed so much, at once provided him with a magnificent piano; but
Cherubini put in force a certain by-law of the Conservatoire excluding
foreigners, and excluded Franz Liszt.</p>

<p>This was a bitter pill to the eager student. He hardly knew how little
he required such patronage. In a very short time "<i>le petit Liszt</i>" was
the great Paris sensation. The old <i>noblesse</i> tried to spoil him with
flattery, the Duchesse de Berri drugged him with bonbons, the Duke of
Orleans called him the "little Mozart." He gave private concerts, at
which Herz, Moscheles, Lafont, and De Beriot, assisted. Rossini would
sit by his side at the piano, and applaud. He was a "miracle." The
company never tired of extolling his "nerve, fougue et originalité,"
while the ladies who petted and caressed him after each performance,
were delighted at his simple and graceful carriage, the elegance of his
language, and the perfect breeding and propriety of his demeanor.</p>

<p>He was only twelve when he played for the first time at the Italian
Opera, and one of those singular incidents which remind one of
Paganini's triumphs occurred. At the close of a <i>bravura cadenza</i>, the
band forgot to come in, so absorbed were the musicians in watching the
young prodigy. Their failure was worth a dozen successes to Liszt. The
ball of the marvellous was fairly set rolling. Gall, the inventor of
phrenology, took a cast of the little Liszt's skull; Talma, the
tragedian, embraced him openly with effusion; and the misanthropic
Marquis de Noailles became his mentor, and initiated him into the art of
painting.</p>

<p>In 1824 Liszt, then thirteen years old, came with his father to England;
his mother returned to Austria. He went down to Windsor to see George
IV., who was delighted with him, and Liszt, speaking of him to me, said:
"I was very young at the time, but I remember the king very well&mdash;a
fine, pompous-looking gentleman." George IV. went to Drury Lane on
purpose to hear the boy, and commanded an encore. Liszt was also heard
in the theatre at Manchester, and in several private houses.</p>

<p>On his return to France, people noticed a change in him. He was now
fourteen, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page334" name="page334"></a>(p. 334)</span> grave, serious, often pre-occupied, already a little
tired of praise, and excessively tired of being called "le petit Liszt."
His vision began to take a wider sweep. The relation between art and
religion exercised him. His mind was naturally devout. Thomas à Kempis
was his constant companion. "Rejoice in nothing but a good deed;"
"Through labor to rest, through combat to victory;" "The glory which men
give and take is transitory," these and like phrases were already deeply
engraven on the fleshly tablets of his heart. Amid all his glowing
triumphs he was developing a curious disinclination to appear in public;
he seemed to yearn for solitude and meditation.</p>

<p>In 1827 he again hurried to England for a short time, but his father's
sudden illness drove them to Boulogne, where, in his forty-seventh year,
died Adam Liszt, leaving the young Franz for the first time in his life,
at the early age of sixteen, unprotected and alone. Rousing himself from
the bodily prostration and torpor of grief into which he had been thrown
by the death of his father, Franz, with admirable energy and that high
sense of honor which always distinguished him, began to set his house in
order. He called in all his debts, sold his magnificent grand "Erard,"
and left Boulogne for Paris with a heavy heart and a light pocket, but
not owing a sou.</p>

<p>He sent for his mother, and for the next twelve years, 1828-1840, the
two lived together, chiefly in Paris. There, as a child, he had been a
nine days' wonder, but the solidity of his reputation was now destined
to go hand in hand with his stormy and interrupted mental and moral
development. Such a plant could not come to maturity all at once. No
drawing-room or concert-room success satisfied a heart for which the
world of human emotion seemed too small, and an intellect piercing with
intuitive intelligence into the "clear-obscure" depths of religion and
philosophy.</p>

<p>But Franz was young, and Franz was poor, and his mother had to be
supported. She was his first care. Systematically, he labored to put by
a sum which would assure her of a competency, and often with his tender
genial smile he would remind her of his own childish words, "God will
help me to repay you for all that you have done for me." Still he
labored, often woefully against the grain. "Poverty," he writes, "that
old mediator between man and evil, tore me from my solitude devoted to
meditation, and placed me before a public on whom not only my own but my
own mother's existence depended. Young and over-strained, I suffered
painfully under the contact with external things which my vocation as a
musician brought with it, and which wounded me all the more intensely
that my heart at this time was filled entirely with the mystical
feelings of love and religion."</p>

<a id="img043" name="img043"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img043.jpg" width="300" height="544" alt="" title="">
<p>Franz Liszt.</p>
</div>

<p>Of course the gifted young pianist's connection grew rapidly. He got his
twenty francs a lesson at the best houses; he was naturally a welcome
guest, and from the first seemed to have the run of high Parisian
society. His life was feverish, his activity irregular, his health far
from strong; but the vulgar temptations of the gay capital seemed to
have little attraction for his noble nature. His heart remained
unspoiled. He was most generous to those who could not <span class="pagenum"><a id="page335" name="page335"></a>(p. 335)</span> afford
to pay for his lessons, most pitiful to the poor, most dutiful and
affectionate to his mother. Coming home late from some grand
entertainment, he would sit outside on the staircase till morning,
sooner than awaken, or perhaps alarm, her by letting himself in. But in
losing his father he seemed to have lost a certain method and order. His
meals were irregular, so were his lessons; more so were the hours
devoted to sleep.</p>

<p>At this time he was hardly twenty; we are not surprised anon to hear in
his own words, of "a female form chaste, and pure as the alabaster of
holy vessel," but he adds: "Such was the sacrifice which I offered with
tears to the God of Christians!"</p>

<p>I will explain. Mlle. Caroline St. Cricq was just seventeen, lithe,
slender, and of "angelic" beauty, with a complexion like a lily flushed
with roses, open, "impressionable to beauty, to the world, to religion,
to God." The countess, her mother, appears to have been a charming
woman, very partial to Liszt, whom she engaged to instruct Mademoiselle
in music. The lessons went not by time, but by inclination. The young
man's eloquence, varied knowledge, ardent love of literature, and
flashing genius won both the mother and daughter. Not one of them seemed
to suspect the whirlpool of grief and death to which they were hurrying.
The countess fell ill and died, but not before she had recommended Liszt
to the Count St. Cricq as a possible suitor for the hand of
Mademoiselle.</p>

<p>The haughty diplomat, St. Cricq, at once put his foot down. The funeral
over, Liszt's movements were watched. They were innocent enough. He was
already an <i>enfant de la maison</i>, but one night he lingered reading
aloud some favorite author to Mademoiselle a little too late. He was
reported by the servants, and received his polite dismissal as music
master. In an interview with the count his own pride was deeply wounded.
"Difference of rank!" said the count. That was quite enough for Liszt.
He rose, pale as death, with quivering lip, but uttered not a word. As a
man of honor he had but one course. He and Caroline parted forever. She
contracted later an uncongenial marriage; he seems to have turned with
intense ardor to religion. His good mother used to complain to those who
came to inquire for him that he was all day long in church, and had
ceased to occupy himself, as he should, with music.</p>

<p>It was toward the close of 1831 that Liszt met Chopin in Paris. From the
first, these two men, so different, became fast friends. Chopin's
delicate, retiring soul found a singular delight in Liszt's strong and
imposing personality. Liszt's exquisite perception enabled him perfectly
to live in the strange dreamland of Chopin's fancies, while his own
vigor inspired Chopin with nerve to conceive those mighty Polonaises
that he could never properly play himself, and which he so gladly
committed to the keeping of his prodigious friend. Liszt undertook the
task of interpreting Chopin to the mixed crowds which he revelled in
subduing, but from which his fastidious and delicately strung friend
shrank with something like aversion.</p>

<p>From Chopin, Liszt and all the world after him got that <i>tempo rubato</i>,
that playing with the duration of notes without breaking the time, and
those arabesque <span class="pagenum"><a id="page336" name="page336"></a>(p. 336)</span> ornaments which are woven like fine embroidery
all about the pages of Chopin's nocturnes, and lift what in others are
mere casual flourishes into the dignity of interpretative phrases and
poetic commentaries on the text.</p>

<p>People were fond of comparing the two young men who so often appeared in
the same salons together&mdash;Liszt with his finely shaped, long, oval head
and <i>profil d'ivoire</i>, set proudly on his shoulders, his stiff hair of
dark blonde thrown back from the forehead without a parting, and cut in
a straight line, his <i>aplomb</i>, his magnificent and courtly bearing, his
ready tongue, his flashing wit and fine irony, his genial <i>bonhomie</i> and
irresistibly winning smile; and Chopin, also, with dark blonde hair, but
soft as silk, parted on one side, to use Liszt's own words, "An angel of
fair countenance, with brown eyes from which intellect beamed rather
than burned; a gentle, refined smile, slightly aquiline nose; a
delicious, clear, almost diaphanous complexion, all bearing witness to
the harmony of a soul which required no commentary beyond itself."</p>

<p>Nothing can be more generous or more true than Liszt's recognition of
Chopin's independent support. "To our endeavors," he says, "to our
struggles, just then so much needing certainty, he lent us the support
of a calm, unshakable conviction, equally armed against apathy and
cajolery." There was only one picture on the walls of Chopin's room; it
hung just above his piano. It was a head of Liszt.</p>

<p>It is no part of my present scheme to describe the battle which
romanticism in music waged against the prevalent conventionalities. We
know the general outcome of the struggle culminating, after the most
prodigious artistic convulsions, in the musical supremacy of Richard
Wagner, who certainly marks firmly and broadly enough the greatest
stride in musical development made since Beethoven.</p>

<p>In 1842 Liszt visited Weimar, Berlin, and then went to Paris; he was
meditating a tour in Russia. Pressing invitations reached him from St.
Petersburg and Moscow. The most fabulous accounts of his virtuosity had
raised expectation to its highest pitch. He was as legendary even among
the common people as Paganini. His first concert at St. Petersburg
realized the then unheard-of sum of £2,000. The roads were crowded to
see him pass, and the corridors and approaches to the Grand Opera
blocked to catch a glimpse of him. The same scenes were repeated at
Moscow, where he gave six concerts without exhausting the popular
excitement.</p>

<p>On his return to Weimar he accepted the post of Capellmeister to the
Grand Duke. It provided him with that settled abode, and above all with
an orchestra, which he now felt so indispensable to meet his growing
passion for orchestral composition. But the time of rest had not yet
come.</p>

<p>In 1844 and 1845 he was received in Spain and Portugal with incredible
enthusiasm, after which he returned to Bonn to assist at the
inauguration of Beethoven's statue. With boundless liberality, he had
subscribed more money than all the princes and people of Germany put
together, to make the statue worthy of the occasion and the occasion
worthy of the statue.</p>

<p>The golden river which poured into him from all the capitals of Europe
now <span class="pagenum"><a id="page337" name="page337"></a>(p. 337)</span> freely found a new vent in boundless generosity. Hospitals,
poor and needy, patriotic celebrations, the dignity and interests of
art, were all subsidized from his private purse. His transcendent
virtuosity was only equalled by his splendid munificence; but he
found&mdash;what others have so often experienced&mdash;that great personal gifts
and prodigious <i>éclat</i> cannot possibly escape the poison of envy and
detraction. He was attacked by calumny; his gifts denied and ridiculed;
his munificence ascribed to vainglory, and his charity to pride and
ostentation; yet none will ever know the extent of his private
charities, and no one who knows anything of Liszt can be ignorant of the
simple, unaffected goodness of heart which prompted them.</p>

<p>Still he was wounded by ingratitude and abuse. It seemed to check and
paralyze for the moment his generous nature. Fétis saw him at Coblenz
soon after the Bonn festival, at which he had expended such vast sums.
He was sitting alone, dejected and out of health. He said he was sick of
everything, tired of life, and nearly ruined. But that mood never lasted
long with Liszt; he soon arose and shook himself like a lion. His
detractors slunk away into their holes, and he walked forth victorious
to refill his empty purse and reap new laurels.</p>

<p>His career was interrupted by the stormy events of 1848. He settled down
for a time at Weimar, and it was then that he began to take that warm
interest in Richard Wagner which ended in the closest and most enduring
of friendships.</p>

<p>He labored incessantly to get a hearing for the "Lohengrin" and
"Tannhäuser." He forced Wagner's compositions on the band, on the
grand-duke; he breasted public opposition and fought nobly for the
eccentric and obscure person who was chiefly known as a political outlaw
and an inventor of extravagant compositions which it was impossible to
play or sing, and odiously unpleasant to listen to. But years of
faithful service, mainly the service and immense <i>prestige</i> and
authority of Liszt, procured Wagner a hearing, and paved the way for his
glorious triumphs at Bayreuth in 1876, 1882, and 1883.</p>

<p>I have preferred to confine myself in this article to the personality of
Liszt, and have made no allusion to his orchestral works and oratorio
compositions. The "Symphonic Poems" speak for themselves&mdash;magnificent
renderings of the inner life of spontaneous emotion&mdash;but subject-matter
which calls for a special article can find no place at the fag-end of
this, and at all times it is better to hear music than to describe it.
As it would be impossible to describe Liszt's orchestration intelligibly
to those who have not heard it, and unnecessary to those who have, I
will simply leave it alone.</p>

<p>I saw Liszt but six times, and then only between the years 1876 and
1881. I heard him play upon two occasions only, and then he played
certain pieces of Chopin at my request and a new composition by himself.
I have heard Mme Schumann, Bülow, Rubenstein, Menter, and Esipoff, but I
can understand that saying of Tausig, himself one of the greatest
masters of <i>technique</i> whom Germany has ever produced: "No mortal can
measure himself with Liszt. He dwells alone upon a solitary height."<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page338" name="page338"></a>(p. 338)</span> RICHARD WAGNER<br>

By <span class="smcap">Franklin Peterson, Mus. Bac.</span><br>

(1813-1883)</h3>

</div>

<p>Richard Wagner's personality has been so overshadowed by and almost
merged in the great controversy which his schemes of reform in opera
raised, that his life and character are often now sorely misjudged&mdash;just
as his music long was&mdash;by those who have not the time, the inclination,
or the ability to understand the facts and the issues. Before briefly
stating then the theories he propounded and their development, as shown
in successive music dramas, it will be well to summarize the story of a
life (1813-83) during which he was called to endure so much vicissitude,
trial and temptation, suffering and defeat.</p>

<p>Born in Leipsic, on May 22, 1813, the youngest of nine children, Wilhelm
Richard was only five months old when his father died. His mother's
second marriage entailed a removal to Dresden, where, at the
Kreuzschule, young Wagner received an excellent liberal education. At
the age of thirteen the bent of his taste, as well as his diligence, was
shown by his translation (out of school hours) of the first twelve books
of the "Odyssey." In the following year his passion for poetry found
expression in a grand tragedy. "It was a mixture," he says, "of Hamlet
and Lear. Forty-two persons died in the course of the play, and, for
want of more characters, I had to make some of them reappear as ghosts
in the last act." Weber, who was then conductor of the Dresden opera,
seems to have attracted the boy both by his personality and by his
music; but it was Beethoven's music which gave him his real inspiration.
From 1830 to 1833 many compositions after standard models are evidence
of hard and systematic work and in 1833 he began his long career as an
operatic composer with "Die Feen" which, however, never reached the
dignity of performance till 1888&mdash;five years after Wagner's death. After
some time spent in very unremunerative routine work in Heidelberg,
Königsberg, and Riga (where in 1836 he married), he resolved, in 1839,
to try his fortune in Paris with "Rienzi," a new opera, written on the
lines of the Paris Grand Opera and with all its great resources in view.
From the month's terrific storm in the North Sea, through which the
vessel struggled to its haven, till the spring of 1842, when Wagner left
Paris with "Rienzi" unperformed, heartsick with hope deferred, his lot
was a hard and bitter one. Berlioz, in similar straits, supported
himself by singing in the chorus of a second-rate theatre. Wagner was
refused even that humble post. In 1842 "Rienzi" was accepted at
Dresden, and its signal success led to his appointment <span class="pagenum"><a id="page339" name="page339"></a>(p. 339)</span> as
Capellmeister there (January, 1843). In the following year the "Flying
Dutchman" was not so enthusiastically received, but it has since easily
distanced the earlier work in popular favor. The story was suggested to
his mind during the stormy voyage from Riga; and it is a remarkable fact
that the wonderful tone-picture of Norway's storm-beaten shore was
painted by one who, till that voyage, had never set eyes on the sea. In
1845 his new opera, "Tannhäuser," proved at first a comparative failure.
The subject, one which had been proposed to Weber in 1814, attracted
Wagner while he was in Paris, and during his studies for the libretto he
found also the first suggestions of "Lohengrin" and "Parsifal." The
temporary failure of the opera led him to the consideration and
self-examination which resulted in the elaborate exposition of his ideal
(in "Opera and Drama," and many other essays). "I saw a single
possibility before me," he writes, "to induce the public to understand
and participate in my aims as an artist." "Lohengrin" was finished early
in 1848, and also the poem of "Siegfried's Tod," the result of Wagner's
studies in the old Nibelungen Lied; but a too warm sympathy with some of
the aims of the revolutionary party (which reigned for two short days
behind the street barricades in Dresden, May, 1849) rendered his absence
from Saxony advisable, and a few days later news reached him in Weimar
that a warrant was issued for his arrest. With a passport procured by
Liszt he fled across the frontier, and for nearly twelve years the
bitterness of exile was added to the hardships of poverty. It is this
period which is mainly responsible for Wagner's polemical writings, so
biting in their sarcasm, and often unfair in their attacks. He was a
good hater; one of the most fiendish pamphlets in existence is the
"Capitulation" (1871), in which Wagner, safe from poverty (thanks to the
kindness of Liszt and the munificence of Ludwig II., of Bavaria), and
nearing the summit of his ambition, but remembering only his misfortunes
and his slights, gloated in public over the horrors which were making a
hell of the fairest city on earth. There is excuse at least, if not
justification, to be found for his attacks on Meyerbeer and others;
there are considerations to be taken into account while one reads with
humiliation and pity the correspondence between Wagner and his
benefactor, Liszt; but it is sad that an affectionate, humane, intensely
human, to say nothing of an artistic, nature, could so blaspheme against
the first principles of humanity.</p>

<p>In 1852 the poem of the "Nibelungen Ring Trilogy" was finished. In 1854
"Rheingold" (the introduction of "Vorabend") was ready, and "Die
Walküre" (Part I.) in 1856. But "tired," as he said, "of heaping one
silent score upon another," he left "Siegfried" unfinished, and turned
to the story of "Tristan." The poem was completed in 1857, and the music
two years later. At last, in 1861, he received permission to return to
Germany, and in Vienna he had the first opportunity of hearing his own
"Lohengrin." For three years the struggle with fortune seems to have
been harder than ever before, and Wagner, in broken health, had
practically determined to give up the unequal contest, when an
invitation was sent him by Ludwig II., the young King of Bavaria&mdash;"Come
here and finish your work." Here at last was salvation for Wagner, and
the rest of his life was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page340" name="page340"></a>(p. 340)</span> comparatively smooth. In 1865 "Tristan
und Isolde" was performed at Munich, and was followed three years later
by a comic opera, "Die Meistersinger," the first sketches of which date
from 1845. "Siegfried" ("Nibelungen Ring," Part II.) was completed in
1869, and in the following year Wagner married Cosima, the daughter of
Liszt, and formerly the wife of Von Bülow. His first wife, from whom he
had been separated in 1861, died at Dresden in 1866.</p>

<p>A theatre built somewhere off the main lines of traffic, and specially
constructed for the performance of Wagner's later works, must have
seemed the most impracticable and visionary of proposals in 1870; and
yet, chiefly through the unwearying exertions of Carl Tausig (and, after
his death, of the various Wagner societies), the foundation-stone of the
Baireuth Theatre was laid in 1872, and in 1876, two years after the
completion of the "Götterdämmerung" ("Nibelungen Ring," Part III.), it
became an accomplished fact. The first work given was the entire
"Trilogy;" and in July, 1882, Wagner's long and stormy career was
magnificently crowned there by the first performance of "Parsifal." A
few weeks later his health showed signs of giving way, and he resolved
to spend the winter at Venice. There he died suddenly, February 13,
1883, and was buried in the garden of his own house, Wahnfried, at
Baireuth.<a id="footnotetag12" name="footnotetag12"></a><a href="#footnote12" title="Go to footnote 12"><span class="smaller">[12]</span></a></p>

<p>Wagner's life and his individuality are of unusual importance in rightly
estimating his work, because, unlike the other great masters, he not
only devoted all his genius to one branch of music&mdash;the opera&mdash;but he
gradually evolved a theory and an ideal which he consciously formulated
and adopted, and perseveringly followed. It may be asked whether
Wagner's premises were sound and his conclusions right; and also whether
his genius was great enough to be the worthy champion of a cause
involving such revolutions. Unless Wagner's operas, considered solely as
music, are not only more advanced in style, but worthy in themselves to
stand at least on a level with the greatest efforts of his predecessors,
no amount of proof that these were wrong and he right will give his name
the place his admirers claim for it. It is now universally acknowledged
that Wagner can only be compared with the greatest names in music. His
instrumentation has the advantage in being the inheritor of the enormous
development of the orchestra from Haydn to Berlioz, his harmony is as
daring and original as Bach's, and his melody is as beautiful as it is
different from Beethoven's or Mozart's. (These names are used not in
order to institute profitless comparisons, but as convenient standards;
therefore even a qualification of the statement will not invalidate the
case.)</p>

<p>His aim (stated very generally) was to reform the whole structure of
opera, using the last or "Beethoven" development of instrumental music
as a basis, and freeing it from the fetters which conventionality had
imposed, in the shape of set forms, accepted arrangements, and
traditional concessions to a style of singing now happily almost
extinct. The one canon was to be dramatic fitness. In this "Art Work of
the Future," as he called it, the interest of the drama is to depend
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page341" name="page341"></a>(p. 341)</span> not entirely on the music, but also on the poem and on the
acting and staging as well. It will be seen that Wagner's theory is not
new. All or most of it is contained in the theories of Gluck and others,
who at various periods in the development of opera consciously strove
after an ideal music drama. But the times were not ripe, and therefore
such music could not exert its proper influence. The twin arts of music
and poetry, dissociated by the rapid advance of literature and the slow
development of music, pursued their several paths alone. The attempt to
reunite them in the end of the sixteenth century was futile, and only
led to opera which never needed, and therefore did not employ, great
poetry. In Germany music was developed along instrumental lines until
the school arrived at its culmination in Beethoven; and when an opera
composer stopped to think on the eternal verities, the result must
always have been such a prophecy of Wagner's work as we find in Mozart's
letters:</p>

<p>"<i>October, 1781.</i>&mdash;Verse indeed is indispensable for music, but rhyme is
bad in its very nature.... It would be by far the best if a good
composer, understanding the theatre and knowing how to produce a piece,
and a clever poet, could be united in one...."</p>

<p>Other but comparatively unimportant features in the Wagner music drama
are, <i>e.g.</i>, the use of the <i>Leitmotiv</i>, or leading motive&mdash;found
occasionally in Gluck, Mozart, Weber, etc., but here first adopted with
a definite purpose, and the contention for mythological rather than
historical subjects&mdash;now largely admitted. But all Wagner's principles
would have been useless without the energy and perseverance which
directed his work, the loving study which stored his memory with all the
great works of his predecessors, and, above all, the genius which
commands the admiration of the musical world.</p>

<p>Wagner's works show a remarkable and progressive development. "Rienzi"
is quite in the grand opera style of Meyerbeer, Spontini, etc. The
"Flying Dutchman" is a deliberate departure from that style, and in
romantic opera strikes out for itself a new line, which, followed still
further in "Tannhäuser," reaches its stage of perfection in "Lohengrin."
From this time dates the music drama, of which "Tristan" is the most
uncompromising type, and by virtue of wonderful orchestration, and the
intense pathos of the beautifully written poem, the most fascinating of
all. The "Trilogy" ("Walküre," "Siegfried," "Götterdämmerung," with the
"Rheingold" as introduction) is a very unequal work. It is full of
Wagner's most inspired writing and most marvellous orchestration; but it
is too long and too diffuse. The plot also is strangely confused and
uninteresting, and fails alike as a story and as a vehicle of theories,
morals, or religion. "Parsifal," with its sacred allegory, its lofty
nobility of tone, and its pure mysticism, stands on a platform by
itself, and is almost above criticism, or praise, or blame. The libretto
alone might have won Wagner immortality, so original is it and perfect
in intention; and the music seems to be no longer a mere accessory to
the effect, but the very essence and fragrance of the great conception.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

(BORN 1813)</h3>

</div>

<p>Giuseppe Verdi, the last and most widely successful of the school of
Italian opera proper, was born at Roncole, near Busseto, October 9,
1813. At ten years he was organist of the small church in his native
village, the salary being raised after a year from £1 8<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> to £1
12<i>s.</i> per annum. At the age of sixteen he was provided with funds to
prosecute his studies at the Conservatorium at Milan; but at the
entrance examination he showed so little evidence of musical talent that
the authorities declined to enroll him. Nothing daunted, he pursued his
studies with ardor under Lavigna, from 1831 to 1833, when, according to
agreement, he returned to Busseto to take the place of his old teacher
Provesi, now deceased.</p>

<p>After five unhappy years in a town where he was little appreciated,
Verdi returned to Milan. His first opera, "Oberto," is chiefly indebted
to Bellini, and the next, "Un Giorno di Regno" (which fulfilled its own
title, as it was only once performed), has been styled "Un Bazar de
Reminiscences." Poor Verdi had just lost his wife and two children
within a few days of each other, so it is hardly to be wondered at that
a comic opera was not a very congenial work, nor successfully
accomplished.</p>

<p>"Nabucodonosor" (1842) was his first hit, and in the next year "I
Lombardi" was even more successful&mdash;partly owing to the revolutionary
feeling which in no small degree was to help him to his future high
position. Indeed, his name was a useful acrostic to the revolutionary
party, who shouted "Viva Verdi," when they meant "Viva Vittorio
Emanuele Re D' Italia." "Ernani," produced at Venice in 1844, also
scored a success, owing to the republican sentiment in the libretto,
which was adapted from Victor Hugo's "Hernani." Many works followed in
quick succession, each arousing the enthusiasm of the audiences, chiefly
when an opportunity was afforded them of expressing their feelings
against the Austrian rule. Only with his sixteenth opera did Verdi win
the supremacy when there were no longer any living competitors; and
"Rigoletto" (1851), "Il Trovatore," and "La Traviata" (1853) must be
called the best, as they are the last of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page343" name="page343"></a>(p. 343)</span> the Italian opera
school. "I Vespri Siciliani" (1855) and "Simon Boccanegra" (1857) were
not so successful as "Un Ballo in Maschera" (1859); and none of them,
any more than "La Forza del Destino" (1862) or "Don Carlos" (1867),
added anything to the fame of the composer of "Il Trovatore."</p>

<p>Only now begins the interest which the student of musical history finds
in Verdi's life. Hitherto he had proved a good man, struggling with
adversity and poverty, a successful composer ambitious to succeed to the
vacant throne of Italian opera. But the keen insight into dramatic
necessity which had gradually developed and had given such force to
otherwise unimportant scenes in earlier operas, also showed him the
insufficiency of the means hitherto at the disposal of Italian
composers, and from time to time he had tried to learn the lessons
taught in the French Grand Opera School, but with poor success. Now a
longer interval seemed to promise a more careful, a more ambitious work,
and when "Aïda" was produced at Cairo (1871), it was at once
acknowledged that a revolution had taken place in Verdi's mind and
method, which might produce still greater results. The influence of
Wagner and the music-drama is distinctly to be felt.</p>

<p>But Verdi was apparently not yet satisfied. For sixteen years the
successful composer maintained absolute silence in opera, when whispers
of a great music-drama roused the expectation of musical Europe to an
extraordinary pitch; nor were the highest expectations disappointed when
"Otello" was produced at Milan in 1887. The surrender of Italian opera
was complete, and Verdi took his right place at the head of the vigorous
new school which has arisen in Italy, and which promises to regain for
the "Land of Song" some of her ancient preeminence in music. A comic
opera by Verdi, "Falstaff," was announced in 1892: it has well sustained
his previous reputation.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h2>DRAMATIC AND LYRIC ARTISTS</h2>




<h3>DAVID GARRICK<br>

By <span class="smcap">Samuel Archer</span><br>

(1716-1779)</h3>


<p>This celebrated actor was the son of Peter Garrick, who had a captain's
commission in the army, but who generally resided at Lichfield. He was
born at Hereford, when his father was on a recruiting party there, and
was baptized in the Church of All-Saints, in that city, on February 20,
1716. Young Garrick received part of his education at the grammar
school there, but he did not apply himself to his books with much
assiduity. He had conceived a very early passion for theatrical <span class="pagenum"><a id="page344" name="page344"></a>(p. 344)</span>
representation, from which nothing could turn him aside. When he was a
little more than eleven years of age, he formed the project of getting a
play acted by young gentlemen and ladies. After he had made some trial
of his own and his companions' abilities, and prevailed upon the parents
to give their consent, he pitched upon the "Recruiting Officer," for the
play. He assembled his little company in a large room, the destined
place of representation. There we may suppose our young boy distributed
the several characters according to the merits of the performer. He
prevailed on one of his sisters to play the part of the chambermaid.
Sergeant Kite, a character of busy intrigue and bold humor, he chose for
himself.</p>

<a id="img047" name="img047"></a>
<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img047.jpg" width="250" height="270" alt="Garrick." title="">
</div>

<p>The play was acted in a manner so far above the expectation of the
audience, that it gave general satisfaction, and was much applauded. The
ease, vivacity, and humor of Kite are still remembered with pleasure at
Lichfield. The first stage attempt of our English Roscius was in 1727.</p>

<p>Not long after, he was invited to Lisbon by an uncle, who was a
considerable wine merchant in that city, but his stay there was very
short, for he returned to Lichfield the year following. It is imagined
that the gay disposition of the young gentleman was not very suitable to
the old man's temper, which was, perhaps, too grave and austere to
relish the vivacities of his nephew.</p>

<p>However, during his short stay at Lisbon, young Garrick made himself
agreeable to all who knew him, particularly to the English merchants who
resided there, with whom he often dined. After dinner they usually
diverted themselves by placing him upon the table, and calling upon him
to repeat verses and speeches from plays, which he did with great
readiness, and much to the satisfaction of the hearers. Some Portuguese
young gentlemen of the highest rank, who were of his own age, were also
much delighted with his conversation.</p>

<p>He afterward returned to Lichfield, and in 1737 came up to town in
company with Samuel Johnson, who was to make so conspicuous a figure in
the literary world, and of whose life we have already given an account.</p>

<p>Soon after his arrival in London, Garrick entered himself at Lincoln's
Inn, and he also put himself under the tuition of Mr. Colson, an eminent
mathematician at Rochester. But as he applied himself little to the
study of the law, his proficiency in mathematics and philosophy was not
extensive. His mind was theatrically led, and nothing could divert his
thoughts from the study of that to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page345" name="page345"></a>(p. 345)</span> which his genius so
powerfully prompted him. He had £1,000 left him by his uncle at Lisbon,
and he engaged for a short time in the wine trade, in partnership with
his brother, Mr. Peter Garrick; they hired vaults in Durham Yard, for
the purpose of carrying on the business. The union between the brothers
was of no long date. Peter was calm, sedate, and methodical; David was
gay, volatile, impetuous, and perhaps not so confined to regularity as
his partner could have wished. To prevent the continuance of fruitless
and daily altercation, by the interposition of friends the partnership
was amicably dissolved. And now Garrick prepared himself in earnest for
that employment which he so ardently loved, and in which nature designed
he should eminently excel.</p>

<p>He was frequently in the company of the most eminent actors; he got
himself introduced to the managers of the theatres, and tried his talent
in the recitation of some particular and favorite portions of plays. Now
and then he indulged himself in the practice of mimicry, a talent which,
however inferior, is never willingly resigned by him who excels in it.
Sometimes he wrote criticisms upon the action and elocution of the
players, and published them in the prints. These sudden effusions of his
mind generally comprehended judicious observations and shrewd remarks,
unmixed with that illiberality which often disgraces the instructions of
stage critics.</p>

<p>Garrick's diffidence withheld him from trying his strength at first upon
a London theatre. He thought the hazard was too great, and embraced the
advantage of commencing his noviciate in acting with a company of
players then ready to set out for Ipswich, under the direction of Mr.
William Gifford and Mr. Dunstall, in the summer of 1741.</p>

<p>The first effort of his theatrical talents was exerted as Aboan, in the
play of "Oroonoko," a part in which his features could not be easily
discerned. Under the disguise of a black countenance, he hoped to escape
being known, should it be his misfortune not to please. Though Aboan is
not a first-rate character, yet the scenes of pathetic persuasion and
affecting distress in which that character is involved, will always
command the attention of the audience when represented by a judicious
actor. Our young player's applause was equal to his most sanguine
desires. Under the assumed name of Lyddal, he not only acted a variety
of characters in plays, particularly Chamont, in the "Orphan;" Captain
Brazen, in the "Recruiting Officer;" and Sir Harry Wildair; but he
likewise gave such delight to the audience, that they gratified him with
constant and loud proofs of their approbation. The town of Ipswich will
long boast of having first seen and encouraged so great a genius as
Garrick.</p>

<p>His first appearance as an actor in London, was on October 19, 1741,
when he performed the part of Richard III., at the playhouse in
Goodman's Fields. His easy and familiar, yet forcible, style in speaking
and acting, at first threw the critics into some hesitation concerning
the novelty, as well as propriety, of his manner. They had been long
accustomed to an elevation of the voice, with a sudden mechanical
depression of its tones, calculated to excite admiration, and to intrap
applause. To the just modulation of the words, and concurring <span class="pagenum"><a id="page346" name="page346"></a>(p. 346)</span>
expression of the features from the genuine works of nature, they had
been strangers, at least for some time. But after he had gone through a
variety of scenes, in which he gave evident proofs of consummate art and
perfect knowledge of character, their doubts were turned into surprise
and astonishment, from which they relieved themselves by loud and
reiterated applause. They were more especially charmed when the actor,
after having thrown aside the hypocrite and politician, assumed the
warrior and the hero. When news was brought to Richard that the Duke of
Buckingham was taken, Garrick's look and action, when he pronounced the
words</p>

<p class="poem30">
<span class="min03em">"</span>&mdash;&mdash;Off with his head!<br>
  So much for Buckingham!"</p>

<p class="noindent">were so magnificent and important, from his visible enjoyment of the
incident, that several loud shouts of approbation proclaimed the triumph
of the actor and satisfaction of the audience. Richard's dream before
the battle, and his death, were accompanied with the loudest
gratulations of applause.</p>

<p>Such was the universal approbation which followed our young actor, that
the more established theatres of Drury Lane and Covent Garden were
deserted. Garrick drew after him the inhabitants of the most polite
parts of the town: Goodman's Fields were full of the splendor of St.
James' and Grosvenor Square; the coaches of the nobility filled up the
space from Temple Bar to Whitechapel. He had so perfectly convinced the
public of his superior accomplishments in acting, that not to admire him
would not only have argued an absence of taste, but the grossest
stupidity. Those who had seen and been delighted with the most admired
of the old actors, confessed that he had excelled the ablest of them in
the variety of the exhibitions, and equalled them all in their must
applauded characters.</p>

<p>Alexander Pope was persuaded by Lord Orrery to see him in the first dawn
of his fame. That great man, who had often seen and admired Betterton,
was struck with the propriety and beauty of Mr. Garrick's action; and as
a convincing proof that he had a good opinion of his merit, he told Lord
Orrery that he was afraid the young man would be spoiled, for he would
have no competitor.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrick shone forth like a theatrical Newton; he threw new light on
elocution and action; he banished ranting, bombast, and grimace; and
restored nature, ease, simplicity, and genuine humor.</p>

<p>In 1742 he entered into stated agreements with Fleetwood, patentee of
Drury Lane, for the annual income of £500. His fame continued to
increase at the royal theatre, and soon became so extended that a
deputation was sent from Ireland, to invite him to act in Dublin during
the months of June, July, and August, upon very profitable conditions.
These he embraced, and crossed the seas to the metropolis of Ireland in
June, 1742, accompanied by Mrs. Woffington.</p>

<a id="img048" name="img048"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img048.jpg" width="600" height="459" alt="" title="">
<p>Garrick as Richard III.</p>
</div>

<p>His success at Dublin exceeded all imagination, though much was expected
from him; he was caressed by all ranks of people as a prodigy of
theatrical accomplishment. During the hottest days in the year the
play-house was crowded <span class="pagenum"><a id="page347" name="page347"></a>(p. 347)</span> with persons of fashion and rank, who
were never tired with seeing and applauding the various essays of his
skill.</p>

<p>The excessive heat became prejudicial to the frequenters of the theatre;
and the epidemical distemper, which seized and carried off great
numbers, was nicknamed the <i>Garrick fever</i>. Satisfied with the
emoluments arising from the summer campaign, and delighted with the
generous encouragement and kind countenance which the nobility and
gentry of Ireland had given him, and of which he always spoke in the
strongest terms of acknowledgment and gratitude, he set out for London,
to renew his labors and to receive the applause of the most critical, as
well as most candid, audience in Europe.</p>

<p>Such an actor as Garrick, whose name when announced in the play-bill
operated like a charm and drew multitudes to the theatre, of consequence
considerably augmented the profits of the patentee. But at the time when
all without doors was apparently gay and splendid, and the theatre of
Drury Lane seemed to be in the most flourishing condition, by the
strange and absurd conduct of the manager the whole fabric was
absolutely running into certain destruction.</p>

<p>His behavior brought on a revolt of the principal actors, with Mr.
Garrick and Mr. Macklin at their head, and for some time they seceded
from the theatre. They endeavored to procure a patent for a new theatre,
but without success; and Garrick at length accommodated his dispute with
the manager, Mr. Fleetwood, by engaging to play again for a salary of
six or seven hundred pounds.</p>

<p>In 1744, Garrick made a second voyage to Dublin, and became
joint-manager of the theatre there with Mr. Sheridan. They met with
great success; and Garrick returned again to London, in May, 1746,
having considerably added to his stock of money. In 1747 he became
joint-patentee of Drury Lane Theatre with Mr. Lacy. Mr. Garrick and Mr.
Lacy divided the business of the theatre in such a manner as not to
encroach upon each other's province. Mr. Lacy took upon himself the care
of the wardrobe, the scenes, and the economy of the household; while
Garrick regulated the more important business of treating with authors,
hiring actors, distributing parts in plays, superintending of
rehearsals, etc. Besides the profits accruing from his half-share, he
was allowed an income of £500 for his acting, and some particular
emoluments for altering plays, farces, etc.</p>

<p>In 1749, Mr. Garrick was married to Mademoiselle Violetti, a young lady
who (as Mr. Davies says), to great elegance of form and many polite
accomplishments, joined the more amiable virtues of the mind. In 1763,
1764, and 1765, he made a journey to France and Italy, accompanied by
Mrs. Garrick, who, from the day of her marriage till the death of her
husband, was never separated from him for twenty-four hours. During his
stay abroad his company was desired by many foreigners of high birth and
great merit. He was sometimes invited to give the company a taste of
that art in which he was known so greatly to excel. Such a request he
very readily consented to, for indeed his compliance cost him nothing.
He could, without the least preparation, transform himself into any
character tragic or comic, and seize instantaneously upon any passion
of the human mind. He could make a sudden transition from violent rage,
and even <span class="pagenum"><a id="page348" name="page348"></a>(p. 348)</span> madness, to the extremes of levity and humor, and go
through the whole circle of theatric evolution with the most surprising
velocity.</p>

<p>On the death of Mr. Lacy, joint patentee of Drury Lane with Mr. Garrick,
in 1773, the whole management of that theatre devolved on Mr. Garrick.
But in 1776, being about sixty years of age, he sold his share of the
patent, and formed a resolution of quitting the stage. He was, however,
determined, before he left the theatre, to give the public proofs of his
abilities to delight them as highly as he had ever done in the flower
and vigor of his life. To this end he presented them with some of the
most capital and trying characters of Shakespeare; with Hamlet, Richard,
and Lear, besides other parts which were less fatiguing. Hamlet and Lear
were repeated; Richard he acted once only, and by the king's command.
His Majesty was much surprised to see him, at an age so advanced, run
about the field of battle with so much fire, force, and agility.</p>

<p>He finished his dramatic race with one of his favorite parts, with
Felix, in "The Wonder a Woman Keeps a Secret." When the play was ended,
Mr. Garrick advanced toward the audience, with much palpitation of mind,
and visible emotion in his countenance. No premeditation whatever could
prepare him for this affecting scene. He bowed&mdash;he paused&mdash;the
spectators were all attention. After a short struggle of nature, he
recovered from the shock he had felt, and addressed his auditors in the
following words:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>: It has been customary with persons under my
circumstances to address you in a farewell epilogue. I had the same
intention, and turned my thoughts that way; but indeed, I found myself
then as incapable of writing such an epilogue, as I should be now of
speaking it.</p>

<p>"The jingle of rhyme and the language of fiction would but ill suit my
present feelings. This is to me a very awful moment; it is no less than
parting forever with those from whom I have received the greatest
kindness and favors, and upon the spot where that kindness and those
favors were enjoyed." [Here he was unable to proceed till he was
relieved by a shower of tears.]</p>

<p>"Whatever may be the changes of my future life, the deepest impression
of your kindness will always remain here" (putting his hand on his
breast) "fixed and unalterable. I will very readily agree to my
successors having more skill and ability for their station than I have;
but I defy them all to take more sincere, and more uninterrupted pains
for your favor, or to be more truly sensible of it, than is your humble
servant."</p>

<p>After a profound obeisance, he retired, amid the tears and acclamations
of a most crowded and brilliant audience.</p>

<p>He died on Wednesday morning, January 20, 1779, at eight o'clock,
without a groan. The disease was pronounced to be a palsy in the
kidneys. On Monday, February 1st, the body of David Garrick was conveyed
from his own house in the Adelphi, and most magnificently interred in
Westminster Abbey, under the monument of his beloved Shakespeare. He was
attended to the grave by persons of the first rank; by men illustrious
for genius, and famous for science; by those who loved him living, and
lamented his death.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/img049.jpg" width="250" height="262" alt="Edwin Forrest." title="">
</div>

<p>Edwin Forrest was born in the city of Philadelphia, March 9, 1806, his
father, a Scotchman, having emigrated to America during the last year of
the preceding century. The boy, like many others of his profession, was
designed for the ministry, and before the age of eleven the future
Channing had attracted admiring listeners by the music of his voice and
the aptness of his mimicry. His memory was remarkable, and he would
recite whole passages of his preceptor's sermons. Perched upon a chair
or stool, and crowned with the proud approval of family and friends, the
young mimic filled the hearts of his listeners with fervent hopes of his
coming success in the fold of their beloved church. These hopes were
destined to be met with disappointment. The bias of the future leader of
the American stage was only faintly outlined as yet; his hour of
development was still to come.</p>

<p>He must have learned early the road to the theatre, permitted to go by
the family, or going, perhaps, without the knowledge or consent of his
seniors in the overworked household; for, before he had passed his tenth
year, our young sermonizer was a member of a Thespian club, and before
he was eleven he had made his appearance at one of the regular theatres
in a female character, but with most disastrous results. He soon outgrew
the ignominy of his first failure, however, and again and again sought
to overcome its disgrace by a fresh appearance. To his appeals the irate
manager lent a deaf ear. The sacred portal that leads to the enchanted
ground of the stage was closed against young Forrest, the warden being
instructed not to let the importunate boy pass the door. At last, in
desperation, he resolved to storm the citadel, to beat down the faithful
guard and to carry war into the enemy's camp. One night he dashed past
the astonished guardian of the stage entrance just as the curtain fell
upon one of the acts of a play. He emerged before the footlights,
eluding all pursuit, dressed as a harlequin, and, before the audience
had recovered from its astonishment at this <span class="pagenum"><a id="page350" name="page350"></a>(p. 350)</span> scene not set down
in the bills, the baffled, but not subdued, aspirant had delivered the
lines of an epilogue in rhyme with so much effect that, before he could
be seized by the astounded stage-manager and hurled from the theatre, he
had attracted public notice, successfully won his surprised audience,
and not only secured immunity from punishment for his temerity, but
actually gained that respect in the manager's estimation which he had so
long and so vainly striven to acquire.</p>

<p>At last Forrest was promised an appearance at the Walnut Street house,
then one of the leading theatres of the country. He selected Young
Norval in Home's tragedy of "Douglas," and on November 27, 1820, the
future master of the American stage, then fourteen years of age&mdash;a boy
in years, a man in character&mdash;announced as "A Young Gentleman of this
City," surrounded by a group of veteran actors who had for many years
shared the favor of the public, began a career which was as auspicious
at its opening as it was splendid in its maturity. At his entrance he
won the vast audience at once by the grace of his figure and the modest
bearing that was natural to him. Something of that magnetism which he
exercised so effectively in late years now attracted all who heard him,
and made friends even before he spoke.</p>

<p>He was allowed to reappear as Frederick in "Lovers' Vows," repeating his
first success; and on January 8, 1821, he benefited as Octavian in the
"Mountaineers," a play associated with the early glories of Edmund Kean.
In this year, also, he made his first and only venture as a manager,
boldly taking the Prune Street Theatre, Philadelphia, and giving a
successful performance of "Richard III.," which not only pleased the
audience, but brought him a few dollars of profit. He made many attempts
to secure a regular engagement in one of the Western circuits, where
experience could be gained; and at last, after many denials, he was
employed by Collins and Jones to play leading juvenile parts in their
theatres in Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Lexington. Thus, at the age of
sixteen or eighteen, Edwin Forrest enrolled himself as a regular member
of a theatrical company, and broke loose from trade forever.</p>

<p>Of his professional progress here we have but poor accounts. He seems to
have been very popular, and to have had an experience larger than he had
heretofore enjoyed. He played with the elder Conway, and was affected by
the grandeur of that actor's Othello, a study which served Forrest well
when in late years he inherited the character.</p>

<p>Jane Placide, who inspired the first love of Edwin Forrest, was an
actress who combined talent, beauty, and goodness. Her character would
have softened the asperities of his, and led him by a calmer path to
those grand elevations toward which Providence had directed his
footsteps. Baffled in love, however, and believing Caldwell to be his
rival and enemy, he challenged him; but was rebuked by the silent
contempt of his manager, whom the impulsive and disappointed lover
"posted."</p>

<p>The hard novitiate of Edwin Forrest was now drawing near its close.
Securing a stock engagement with Charles Gilfert, manager of the Albany
Theatre, he <span class="pagenum"><a id="page351" name="page351"></a>(p. 351)</span> opened there in the early fall, and played for the
first time with Edmund Kean, then on his second visit to America. The
meeting with this extraordinary man and the attention he received from
him were foremost among the directing influences of Forrest's life. To
his last hour he never wearied of singing the praises of Kean, whose
genius filled the English-speaking world with admiration. Two men more
unlike in mind and body can scarcely be imagined. Until now Forrest had
seen no actor who represented in perfection the impassioned school of
which Kean was the master. He could not have known Cooke, even in the
decline of that great tragedian's power, and the little giant was indeed
a revelation. He played Iago to Kean's Othello, Titus to his Brutus, and
Richmond to his Richard III.</p>

<p>In the interval which preceded the opening of the Bowery Theatre, New
York, Forrest appeared at the Park for the benefit of Woodhull, playing
Othello. He made a pronounced success, his old manager sitting in front,
profanely exclaiming, "By God, the boy has made a hit!" This was a great
event, as the Park was then the leading theatre of America, and its
actors were the most famous and exclusive.</p>

<p>He opened at the Bowery Theatre in November, 1826, as Othello, and made
a brilliant impression. His salary was raised from $28 to $40 per week.
From this success may be traced the first absolute hold made by Edwin
Forrest upon the attention of cultivated auditors and intelligent
critics. The Bowery was then a very different theatre from what it
afterward became, when the newsboys took forcible possession of its pit
and the fire-laddies were the arbiters of public taste in its
neighborhood.</p>

<p>An instance of Forrest's moral integrity may be told here. He had been
approached by a rival manager, after his first success, and urged to
secede from the Bowery and join the other house at a much larger salary.
He scornfully refused to break his word, although his own interests he
knew must suffer. His popularity at this time was so great that, when
his contract for the season had expired, he was instantly engaged for
eight nights, at a salary of two hundred dollars a night.</p>

<p>The success which had greeted Forrest on his first appearance in New
York, was renewed in every city in the land. Fortune attended fame, and
filled his pockets, as the breath of adulation filled his heart. He had
paid the last penny of debt left by his father, and had seen a firm
shelter raised over the head of his living family. With a patriotic
feeling for all things American, Forrest, about this time, formed a plan
for the encouragement or development of an American drama, which
resulted in heavy money losses to himself, but produced such
contributions to our stage literature as the "Gladiator," "Jack Cade,"
and "Metamora."<a id="footnotetag14" name="footnotetag14"></a><a href="#footnote14" title="Go to footnote 14"><span class="smaller">[14]</span></a> After five years of constant labor he felt that he
had earned the right to a holiday, and he formed his plans for a two
years' absence in Europe. A <span class="pagenum"><a id="page352" name="page352"></a>(p. 352)</span> farewell banquet was tendered him
by the citizens of New York, and a medal was struck in honor of the
occasion. Bryant, Halleck, Leggett, Ingraham and other distinguished men
were present. This was an honor which had never before been paid to an
American actor.</p>

<p>He had been absent about two years when he landed in New York in
September, 1836. On his appearance at the Walnut Street Theatre,
Philadelphia, he was received with unprecedented enthusiasm. He gave six
performances only, on this occasion, and each saw a repetition of the
scene at the beginning of the engagement. The receipts were the largest
ever known in that house.</p>

<p>On September 19, 1836, Forrest embarked once more for the mother
country, this time with serious purpose. After a speedy and uneventful
passage he reached England, and at once set about the preliminary
business of his British engagement, which began October 17, 1836. He was
the first really great American actor who had appeared in London as a
rival of the English tragedians; for Cooper was born in England, though
always regarded as belonging to the younger country. His opening part
was Spartacus in the "Gladiator." The play was condemned, the actor
applauded. In Othello, in Lear, and in Macbeth, he achieved instant
success. He began his engagement October 17th and closed December 19th,
having acted Macbeth seven times, Othello nine, and King Lear eight. A
dinner at the Garrick Club was offered and accepted. Here he sat down
with Charles Kemble and Macready; Sergeant Talfourd was in the chair.</p>

<p>It was during this engagement he met his future wife, Miss Catherine
Sinclair. In the latter part of June, 1837, the marriage took place in
St. Paul's Church, Covent Garden. Mr. and Mrs. Forrest soon after
embarked for America. The tragedian resumed his American engagements
November 15, 1837, at the old Chestnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia.
Presented to his friends, his wife at once made a deep and lasting
impression. Her native delicacy of mind and refinement of manners
enchanted those who hoped for some such influence to be exerted in
softening the rough vigor and democratic downrightness of the man.
Domestic discord came too soon, however, and in an evil hour for
himself, in an evil hour for his art and for the struggling drama in
America, Edwin Forrest threw open the doors of his home to the scrutiny
of the world, and appealed to the courts to remove the skeleton which
was hidden in his closet. With the proceedings of that trial, which
resulted in divorce, alimony, and separation, this memoir has nothing to
do.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img050.jpg" width="300" height="469" alt="" title="">
<p>Forrest as Metamora.</p>
</div>

<p>Edwin Forrest, leaving the court-room a defeated man, was instantly
raised to a popularity with the masses beyond anything even he had
before experienced. He began an engagement soon after at the Broadway
Theatre, opening as Damon. The house was crowded to suffocation. The
engagement of sixty nights was unparalleled in the history of the
American drama for length and profit. But despite the flattering
applause of the multitude, life never again had for him the smiling
aspect it had so often worn before. The applause which filled his ears,
the wealth which flowed in upon him could not improve that temper which
had never been amiable, and all the hard stories of his life belong to
this period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page353" name="page353"></a>(p. 353)</span> On September 20, 1852, he reappeared at the Broadway Theatre,
New York. In February, 1853, "Macbeth" was produced in grand style, with
new scenery and appointments. The tragedy was played on twenty
consecutive nights, then by far the longest run of any Shakespearean
play in America. The cast was very strong. It included Conway, Duff,
Davenport, Pope, Davidge, Barry, and Madame Ponisi.</p>

<p>On September 17, 1860, after an absence of nearly four years, Edwin
Forrest appeared again on the stage. He was engaged by James Nixon, and
began his contract of one hundred nights at Niblo's Garden, New York, in
the character of Hamlet. The long retirement only increased the curious
interest which centred round his historic name. Upon his opening night
the seats were sold at auction. His success in Philadelphia rivalled
that of New York. In Boston the vast auditorium of the grandest theatre
in America was found too small to contain the crowds he drew.</p>

<p>Severe attacks of gout were beginning to tell upon that herculean form,
sapping and undermining it; and in 1865, while playing Damon at the
Holiday Street Theatre, in Baltimore, the weather being very cold and
the theatre open to draughts, he was seized with a sudden illness, which
was followed by very serious results. Suffering the most intense agony,
he was able to get to the end of the part; but when his robes were laid
aside and physicians summoned, it was found to his horror that he had
suffered a partial paralysis of the sciatic nerve. In an instant the
sturdy gait, the proud tread of the herculean actor was forever gone;
for he never regained complete control of his limb, a perceptible hobble
being the legacy of the dreadful visitation. His right hand was almost
powerless, and he could not hold his sword.</p>

<p>In 1866 he went to California, urged by the manager in San Francisco.
His last engagement in New York took place in February, 1871. He played
Lear and Richelieu, his two greatest parts. On the night of March 25,
1872, Forrest opened in "Lear" at the Globe Theatre, Boston. "Lear" was
played six nights. During the second week he was announced for Richelieu
and Virginius; but he caught a violent cold on Sunday, and labored
sorely on Monday evening through the part of Richelieu. On Tuesday he
repeated the performance, against the advice of friends and physicians.
Rare bursts of his old power lighted up the play, but he labored
piteously on against his illness and threatened pneumonia. When
stimulants were offered he rejected them, declaring "that if he died
to-night, he should still be his old royal self."</p>

<p>Announced for Virginius the following evening, he was unable to appear.
A severe attack of pneumonia developed itself. He was carried to his
hotel, and his last engagement was brought to an abrupt and melancholy
end. As soon as he was able to move, he left Boston for his home in
Philadelphia, resting on his way only a day in New York. As the summer
passed away, the desire for work grew stronger and stronger, and he
decided to re-enter public life, but simply as a reader of the great
plays in which he had as an actor been so successful. The result was a
disappointment. On December 11, 1872, he wrote to Oakes his <span class="pagenum"><a id="page354" name="page354"></a>(p. 354)</span>
last letter, saying sadly, but fondly: "God bless you ever, my dear and
much-beloved friend."</p>

<p>When the morning of December 12th came, his servant, hearing no sound in
his chamber at his general hour of rising, became alarmed, opened his
master's door, and found there, cold in death upon his bed, the form of
the great tragedian. His arms were crossed upon his bosom, and he seemed
to be at rest. The stroke had come suddenly. With little warning, and
without pain, he had passed away.</p>

<p>The dead man's will was found to contain several bequests to old friends
and servants, and an elaborate scheme by which his fortune, in the hands
of trustees, was to be applied to the erection and support of a retreat
for aged actors, to be called "The Edwin Forrest Home." The idea had
been long in his mind, and careful directions were drawn up for its
practical working; but the trustees found themselves powerless to
realize fully the hopes and wishes of the testator. A settlement had to
be made to the divorced wife, who acted liberally toward the estate; but
the amount withdrawn seriously crippled it, as it was deprived at once
of a large sum of ready money. Other legal difficulties arose. And thus
the great ambition of the tragedian to be a benefactor to his profession
was destined to come almost to naught. Of this happily little he recks
now. He has parted with all the cares of life, and has at last found
rest.</p>

<p>Forrest's greatest Shakespearean parts were Lear, Othello, and
Coriolanus. The first grew mellow and rich as the actor grew in years,
while it still retained much of its earlier force. His Othello suffered
with the decline of his faculties, although his clear conception of all
he did was apparent to the end in the acting of every one of his parts.
Coriolanus died with him, the last of all the Romans. He was greatest,
however, in such parts as Virginius, William Tell, and Spartacus. Here
his mannerisms of gait and utterance were less noticeable than in his
Shakespearean characters, or were overlooked in the rugged massiveness
of the creation. Hamlet, Richard, and Macbeth were out of his
temperament, and added nothing to his fame; but Richelieu is said to
have been one of his noblest and most impressive performances. He was in
all things marked and distinctive. His obtrusive personality often
destroyed the harmony of the portrait he was painting; but in his
inspired moments, which were many, his touches were sublime. He passed
over quiet scenes with little elaboration, and dwelt strongly upon the
grand features of the characters he represented. His Lear, in the great
scenes, rose to a majestic height, but fell in places almost to
mediocrity. His art was unequal to his natural gifts. He was totally
unlike his great contemporary and rival, Macready, whose attention to
detail gave to every performance the harmony of perfect work.</p>

<p>This memoir may fitly close with an illustrative anecdote of the great
actor. Toward the end of his professional career he was playing an
engagement at St. Louis. He was very feeble in health, and his lameness
was a source of great anxiety to him. Sitting at a late supper in his
hotel one evening, after a performance of "King Lear," with his friend
J. B. McCullough, of the <i>Globe-Democrat</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page355" name="page355"></a>(p. 355)</span> that gentleman
remarked to him: "Mr. Forrest, I never in my life saw you play Lear so
well as you did to-night." Whereupon the veteran almost indignantly
replied, rising slowly and laboriously from his chair to his full
height: "Play Lear! What do you mean, sir? I do not play Lear! I play
Hamlet, Richard, Shylock, Virginius, if you please, but by God, sir, I
<i>am</i> Lear!"</p>

<p>Nor was this wholly imaginative. Ingratitude of the basest kind had rent
his soul. Old friends were gone from him; new friends were but
half-hearted. His hearthstone was desolate. The public, to whom he had
given his best years, was becoming impatient of his infirmities. The
royalty of his powers he saw by degrees torn from his decaying form.
Other kings had arisen on the stage, to whom his old subjects now showed
a reverence once all his own. The mockery of his diadem only remained. A
wreck of the once proud man who had despised all weakness, and had ruled
his kingdom with imperial sway, he now stood alone. Broken in health and
in spirit, deserted, forgotten, unkinged, he might well exclaim, "<i>I am
Lear!</i>"<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>





<h3>CHARLOTTE CUSHMAN<br>

By <span class="smcap">Dutton Cook</span><br>

(1816-1876)</h3>

<a id="img051" name="img051"></a>
<div class="floatleft">

</div>

<p>The Pilgrim Fathers figure in American pedigrees almost as frequently
and persistently as Norman William and his followers appear at the trunk
of our family-trees. Certainly, the Mayflower must have carried very
many heads of houses across the Atlantic. It was not in the Mayflower,
however, but in the Fortune, a smaller vessel, of fifty-five tons, that
Robert Cushman, Nonconformist, the founder of the Cushman family in
America, sailed from England, for the better enjoyment of liberty of
conscience and freedom of religion. In the seventh generation from
Robert Cushman appeared Elkanah Cushman, who took to wife Mary Eliza,
daughter of Erasmus Babbit, Jr., lawyer, musician, and captain in the
army. Of this marriage was born Charlotte Saunders Cushman, in Richmond
Street, Boston, July 23, 1816, and other children.</p>

<p>Charlotte Cushman says of herself: "I was born a tom-boy." She had a
passion for climbing trees and for breaking open dolls' heads. She
could not <span class="pagenum"><a id="page356" name="page356"></a>(p. 356)</span> make dolls' clothes, but she could manufacture their
furniture&mdash;could do anything with tools. "I was very destructive to toys
and clothes, tyrannical to brothers and sister, but very social, and a
great favorite with other children. Imitation was a prevailing trait."
The first play she ever saw was "Coriolanus," with Macready in the
leading part; her second play was "The Gamester." She became noted in
her school for her skill in reading aloud. Her competitors grumbled: "No
wonder she can read; she goes to the theatre!" Until then she had been
shy and reserved, not to say stupid, about reading aloud in school,
afraid of the sound of her own voice, and unwilling to trust it; but
acquaintance with the theatre loosened her tongue, as she describes it,
and gave opportunity and expression to a faculty which became the ruling
passion of her life. At home, as a child, she took part in an operetta
founded upon the story of "Bluebeard," and played Selim, the lover, with
great applause, in a large attic chamber of her father's house before an
enthusiastic audience of young people.</p>

<p>Elkanah Cushman had been for some years a successful merchant, a member
of the firm of Topliffe &amp; Cushman, Long Wharf, Boston. But failure
befell him, "attributable," writes Charlotte Cushman's biographer, Miss
Stebbins, "to the infidelity of those whom he trusted as supercargoes."
The family removed from Boston to Charlestown. Charlotte was placed at a
public school, remaining there until she was thirteen only. Elkanah
Cushman died, leaving his widow and five children with very slender
means. Mrs. Cushman opened a boarding-house in Boston, and struggled
hard to ward off further misfortune. It was discovered that Charlotte
possessed a noble voice of almost two registers, "a full contralto and
almost a full soprano; but the low voice was the natural one." The
fortunes of the family seemed to rest upon the due cultivation of
Charlotte's voice and upon her future as a singer. "My mother," she
writes, "at great self-sacrifice gave me what opportunities for
instruction she could obtain for me; and then my father's friend, Mr. R.
D. Shepherd, of Shepherdstown, Va., gave me two years of the best
culture that could be obtained in Boston at that time, under John
Paddon, an English organist and teacher of singing." When the English
singer, Mrs. Wood&mdash;better known, perhaps, as Miss Paton&mdash;visited Boston
in 1835 or 1836, she needed the support of a contralto voice. Charlotte
Cushman was sent for, and rehearsed duets with Mrs. Wood. The young
beginner was advised to prepare herself for the operatic stage; she was
assured that such a voice would "lead her to any height of fortune she
coveted." She became the articled pupil of Mr. Maeder, the husband of
Clara Fisher, actress and vocalist, and the musical director of Mr. and
Mrs. Wood. Instructed by Maeder, Miss Cushman undertook the parts of the
Countess in "The Marriage of Figaro" and Lucy Bertram in the opera of
"Guy Mannering." These were her first appearances upon the stage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maeder's voice was a contralto; it became necessary, therefore, to
assign soprano parts to Miss Cushman. Undue stress was thus laid upon
her upper notes. She was very young, and she felt the change of climate
when she went on with the Maeders to New Orleans. It is likely that her
powers as a singer <span class="pagenum"><a id="page357" name="page357"></a>(p. 357)</span> had been tried too soon and too severely;
her operatic career was brought to a sudden close. Her voice failed her;
her upper notes departed, never to return; she was left with a weakened
and limited contralto register. Alarmed and wretched, she sought counsel
of Mr. Caldwell, the manager of the chief New Orleans theatre. "You
ought to be an actress, and not a singer," he said, and advised her to
take lessons of Mr. Barton, his leading tragedian. Her articles of
apprenticeship to Maeder were cancelled. Soon she was ready to appear as
Lady Macbeth on the occasion of Barton's benefit.</p>

<p>The season ended, she sailed for Philadelphia on her way to New York.
Presently she had entered into a three years' engagement with Mr.
Hamblin, the manager of the Bowery Theatre, at a salary of twenty-five
dollars a week for the first year, thirty-five for the second year, and
forty-five for the third. Mr. Hamblin had received excellent accounts of
the actress from his friend, Mr. Barton, of New Orleans, and had heard
her rehearse scenes from "Macbeth," "Jane Shore," "Venice Preserved,"
"The Stranger," etc. To enable her to obtain a suitable wardrobe, he
became security for her with his tradespeople, deducting five dollars a
week from her salary until the debt was satisfied. All promised well;
independence seemed secure at last. Mrs. Cushman was sent for from
Boston; she gave up her boarding-house and hastened to her daughter.
Miss Cushman writes: "I got a situation for my eldest brother in a store
in New York. I left my only sister in charge of a half-sister in Boston,
and I took my youngest brother with me." But rheumatic fever seized the
actress; she was able to act for a few nights only, and her dream of
good fortune came to a disastrous close. "The Bowery Theatre was burned
to the ground, with all my wardrobe, all my debt upon it, and my three
years' contract ending in smoke." Grievously distressed, but not
disheartened, with her family dependent upon her exertions, she accepted
an engagement at the principal theatre in Albany, where she remained
five months, acting all the leading characters. In September, 1837, she
entered into an engagement, which endured for three years, with the
manager of the Park Theatre, New York. She was required to fulfil the
duties of "walking lady" and "general utility" at a salary of twenty
dollars a week.</p>

<p>During this period of her career she performed very many characters, and
toiled assiduously at her profession. It was then the custom to afford
the public a great variety of performances, to change the plays nightly,
and to present two and sometimes three plays upon the same evening. The
actors were forever busy studying new parts, and, when they were not
performing, they were rehearsing. "It was a time of hard work," writes
Miss Stebbins, "of ceaseless activity, and of hard-won and scantily
accorded appreciation." Miss Cushman had no choice of parts; she was not
the chief actress of the company; she sustained without question all the
characters the management assigned to her. Her appearance as Meg
Merrilies (she acquired subsequently great favor by her performance of
this character) was due to an incident&mdash;the illness of Mrs. Chippendale,
the actress who usually supported the part. It was in the year 1840;
the veteran Braham was to appear as Henry Bertram. A Meg Merrilies had
to be <span class="pagenum"><a id="page358" name="page358"></a>(p. 358)</span> improvised. The obscure "utility" actress was called upon
to take Mrs. Chippendale's place. She might read the part if she could
not commit it to memory but personate Meg Merrilies after some sort she
must. She had never especially noticed the part; but as she stood at the
side scene, book in hand, awaiting her moment of entrance, her ear
caught the dialogue going on upon the stage between two of the gypsies,
"conveying the impression that Meg was no longer to be feared or
respected&mdash;that she was no longer in her right mind." This furnished her
with a clew to the character, and led her to present it upon the stage
as the weird and startling figure which afterward became so famous. Of
course, the first performance was but a sketch of her later portrayals
of Meg Merrilies, yet she made a profound impression. "I had not thought
that I had done anything remarkable," she wrote, "and when a knock came
at my dressing-room door, and I heard Braham's voice, my first thought
was, 'Now what have I done? He is surely displeased with me about
something.' Imagine my gratification, when Mr. Braham said, 'Miss
Cushman, I have come to thank you for the most veritable sensation I
have experienced for a long time. I give you my word, when I saw you in
that first scene I felt a cold chill run all over me. Where have you
learned to do anything like that?'"</p>

<p>During her visits to England, Miss Cushman personated Meg Merrilies more
often than any other character. In America she was also famous for her
performance of Nancy, in a melodrama founded upon "Oliver Twist;" but
this part she did not bring with her across the Atlantic. She had first
played Nancy during her "general utility" days at the Park Theatre, when
the energy and pathos of her acting powerfully affected her audience,
and the tradition of her success in the part long "lingered in the
memory of managers, and caused them, ever and anon, as their business
interests prompted, to bring great pressure to bear upon her for a
reproduction of it." Mr. George Vandenhoff describes Nancy as Miss
Cushman's "greatest part; fearfully natural, dreadfully intense,
horribly real."</p>

<p>In the winter of 1842 Miss Cushman undertook the management of the
Walnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia, which was then in rather a fallen
state. Under her energetic rule, however, the establishment recovered
its popularity. "She displayed at that day," writes Mr. George
Vandenhoff&mdash;who "starred at the Walnut Street Theatre for six nights to
small audiences"&mdash;"a rude, strong, uncultivated talent. It was not till
after she had seen and acted with Mr. Macready&mdash;which she did the next
season&mdash;that she really brought artistic study and finish to her
performances." Macready arrived in New York in the autumn of 1843. He
notes: "The Miss Cushman, who acted Lady Macbeth, interested me much.
She has to learn her art, but she showed mind and sympathy with me&mdash;a
novelty so refreshing to me on the stage." She discerned the opportunity
for study and improvement presented by Macready's visit, and underwent
the fatigue of acting on alternate nights in Philadelphia and New York
during the term of his engagement at the Park Theatre. Her own success
was very great. She wrote to her mother of her great reception: of her
being called out after the play; of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page359" name="page359"></a>(p. 359)</span> "hats and handkerchiefs
waved to me; flowers sent to me," etc. In October, 1844, she sailed for
England in the packet-ship Garrick. She had little money with her. A
farewell benefit taken in Boston, her native city, had not proved very
productive, and she had been obliged "to make arrangements for the
maintenance of her family during her absence." And with characteristic
prudence she left behind her a certain sum, to be in readiness for her,
in case failure in England should drive her promptly back to America.</p>

<p>No engagement in London had been offered her; but she received, upon her
arrival, a letter from Macready, proposing that she should join a
company then being formed to give representations in Paris. She thought
it prudent to decline this proposal, however, so as to avoid entering
into anything like rivalry with Miss Helen Faucit, the leading actress
of the troupe. She visited Paris for a few days, but only to sit with
the audience of the best French theatres. She returned to her dull
lodgings in Covent Garden, "awaiting her destiny." She was fond, in
after years, of referring to the struggles and poverty, the hopes and
the despair, of her first sojourn in London. Her means were nearly
exhausted. Sally, the dresser, used to relate: "Miss Cushman lived on a
mutton-chop a day, and I always bought the baker's dozen of muffins for
the sake of the extra one, and we ate them all, no matter how stale they
were, and we never suffered from want of appetite in those days." She
found herself reduced to her last sovereign, when Mr. Maddox, the
manager of the Princess's Theatre, came to her with a proposal. The
watchful Sally reported that he had been walking up and down the street
for some time early in the morning, too early for a visit. "He is
anxious," said Miss Cushman. "I can make my own terms." He wished her to
appear with Forrest, the American tragedian, then visiting the London
stage for the second and last time. She stipulated that she should have
her opportunity first, and "alone." If successful, she was willing to
appear in support of Forrest. So it was agreed.</p>

<p>Her first appearance upon the English stage was made on February 14,
1845; she assumed the character of Bianca, in Dean Milman's rather dull
tragedy of "Fazio." Her triumph was indisputable. Her intensity and
vehemence completely carried away the house. As the pit rose at Kean's
Shylock, so it rose at Charlotte Cushman's Bianca. She wrote to her
mother in America: "All my success put together, since I have been upon
the stage, would not come near my success in London." The critics
described, as the crowning effort of her performance, the energy and
pathos and abandonment of her appeal to Aldabella, when the wife
sacrifices her pride, and sinks, "huddled into a heap," at the feet of
her rival, imploring her to save the life of Fazio. Miss Cushman,
speaking of her first performance in London, was wont to relate how she
was so completely overcome, not only by the excitement of the scene, but
by the nervous agitation of the occasion, that she lost for the moment
her self-command, and was especially grateful for the long-continued
applause which gave her time to recover herself. When she slowly rose at
last and faced the house again, the spectacle of its enthusiasm
thrilled and impressed her in a manner she could never <span class="pagenum"><a id="page360" name="page360"></a>(p. 360)</span> forget.
The audience were standing; some had mounted on the benches; there was
wild waving of hats and handkerchiefs, a storm of cheering, great
showering of bouquets.</p>

<p>Her second character in London was Lady Macbeth, to the Macbeth of Edwin
Forrest; but the American actor failed to please, and the audience gave
free expression to their discontent. Greatly disgusted, Forrest
withdrew, deluding himself with the belief that he was the victim of a
conspiracy. Miss Cushman's success knew no abatement. She played a round
of parts, assisted by James Wallack, Leigh Murray, and Mrs. Stirling,
appearing now as Rosalind, now as Juliana in "The Honeymoon," as Mrs.
Haller, as Beatrice, as Julia in "The Hunchback." Her second season was
even more successful than her first. After a long provincial tour she
appeared in December, 1845, as Romeo at the Haymarket Theatre, then
under the management of Mr. Webster, her sister Susan assuming the
character of Juliet. She had sent for her family to share her
prosperity, and had established them in a furnished house at Bayswater.</p>

<p>Her success as Romeo was very great. The tragedy was played for eighty
nights. Her performance won applause even from those most opposed to the
representation of Shakespeare's hero by a woman. For a time her intense
earnestness of speech and manner, the passion of her interviews with
Juliet, the fury of her combat with Tybalt, the despair of her closing
scenes, bore down all opposition, silenced criticism, and excited her
audience to an extraordinary degree. She appeared afterward, but not in
London, as Hamlet, following an unfortunate example set by Mrs. Siddons;
and as Ion in Talfourd's tragedy of that name.</p>

<p>In America, toward the close of her career, she even ventured to appear
as Cardinal Wolsey, obtaining great applause by her exertions in the
character, and the skill and force of her impersonation. But histrionic
feats of this kind trespass against good taste, do violence to the
intentions of the dramatists, and are, in truth, departures from the
purpose of playing. Miss Cushman had for excuse&mdash;in the first instance,
at any rate&mdash;her anxiety to forward the professional interests of her
sister, who, in truth, had little qualification for the stage, apart
from her good looks and her graces of manner. The sisters had played
together in Philadelphia in "The Genoese"&mdash;a drama written by a young
American&mdash;when, to give support and encouragement to Susan in her
personation of the heroine, Charlotte undertook the part of her lover.
Their success prompted them to appear in "Romeo and Juliet." Other
plays, in which both could appear, were afterward selected&mdash;such, for
instance, as "Twelfth Night," in which Charlotte played Viola to the
Olivia of Susan&mdash;so that the engagement of one might compel the
engagement of the other. Susan, however, quitted the stage in 1847, to
become the wife of Dr. Sheridan Muspratt, of Liverpool.</p>

<p>Charlotte Cushman as Mrs. Haller.</p>

<p>Charlotte Cushman called few new plays into being. Dramas, entitled
"Infatuation," by James Kenny, in 1845, and "Duchess Elinour," by the
late H. F. Chorley, in 1854, were produced for her, but were summarily
condemned by the audience, being scarcely permitted indeed a second
performance in either case. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page361" name="page361"></a>(p. 361)</span> Otherwise, she did not add to her
repertory. For many years she led the life of a "star," fulfilling brief
engagements here and there, appearing now for a term in London, and now
travelling through the provinces, playing some half a dozen characters
over and over again. Of these Lady Macbeth, Queen Katherine and Meg
Merrilies were perhaps the most frequently demanded. Her fame and
fortune she always dated from the immediate recognition she obtained
upon her first performance in London. But she made frequent visits to
America; indeed, she crossed the Atlantic "upward of sixteen times,"
says her biographer. In 1854 she took a house in Bolton Row, Mayfair,
"where for some years she dispensed the most charming and genial
hospitality," and, notably, entertained Ristori on her first visit to
England in 1856. Several winters she passed in Rome, occupying
apartments in the Via Gregoriana, where she cordially received a host of
friends and visitors of all nations. In 1859 she was called to England
by her sister's fatal illness; in 1866 she was again summoned to England
to attend the death-bed of her mother. In 1860 she was playing in all
the chief cities of America. Three years later she again visited
America, her chief object being to act for the benefit of the Sanitary
Commission, and aid the sick and wounded victims of the civil war.
During the late years of her life she appeared before the public more as
a dramatic reader than as an actress. There were long intervals between
her theatrical engagements; she seemed to quit her profession only to
return to it after an interval with renewed appetite, and she incurred
reproaches because of the frequency of her farewells, and the doubt that
prevailed as to whether her "last appearances" were really to be the
"very last." It was not until 1874, however, that she took final leave
of the New York stage, amid extraordinary enthusiasm, with many poetic
and other ceremonies. She was the subject of addresses in prose and
verse. Mr. Bryant, after an eloquent speech, tendered her a laurel
wreath bound with white ribbon resting upon a purple velvet cushion,
with a suitable inscription embroidered in golden letters; a
torchbearers' procession escorted her from the theatre to her hotel; she
was serenaded at midnight, and in her honor Fifth Avenue blazed with
fireworks. After this came farewells to Philadelphia, Boston and other
cities, and to these succeeded readings all over the country. It is to
be said, however, that incessant work had become a necessity with her,
not because of its pecuniary results, but as a means of obtaining mental
relief or comparative forgetfulness for a season. During the last five
or six years of her life she was afflicted with an incurable and
agonizing malady. Under most painful conditions she toiled unceasingly,
moving rapidly from place to place, and passing days and nights in
railway journeys. In a letter to a friend, she writes: "I do get so
dreadfully depressed about myself, and all things seem so hopeless to me
at those times, that I pray God to take me quickly at any moment, so
that I may not torture those I love by letting them see my pain. But
when the dark hour passes, and I try to forget by constant occupation
that I have such a load near my heart, then it is not so bad." She died
almost painlessly at last on February 18, 1876.</p>

<p>Charlotte Cushman may assuredly be accounted an actress of genius in
right <span class="pagenum"><a id="page362" name="page362"></a>(p. 362)</span> of her originality, her vivid power of depicting
emotion, the vehemence and intensity of her histrionic manner. Her best
successes were obtained in tragedy, although she possessed a keen sense
of humor, and could deliver the witty speeches of Rosalind or of
Beatrice with excellent point and effect. Her Meg Merrilies will
probably be remembered as her most impressive achievement. It was
really, as she played it, a character of her own invention; but, in
truth, it taxed her intellectual resources far less than her Bianca, her
Queen Katherine, or her Lady Macbeth. Her physical peculiarities no
doubt limited the range of her efforts, hindered her advance as an
actress, or urged her toward exceptional impersonations. Her
performances lacked femininity, to use Coleridge's word; but in power to
stir an audience, to touch their sympathies, to kindle their enthusiasm,
and to compel their applause, she takes rank among the finest players.
It only remains to add that Miss Stebbins' fervid and affecting
biography of her friend admirably demonstrates that the woman was not
less estimable than the actress; that Charlotte Cushman was of noble
character, intellectual, large and tenderhearted, of exemplary conduct
in every respect. The simple, direct earnestness of her manner upon the
mimic scene, characterized her proceedings in real life. She was at once
the slave and the benefactress of her family; she was devotedly fond of
children; she was of liberal and generous nature; she was happiest when
conferring kindness upon others; her career abounded in self-sacrifice.
She pretended to few accomplishments, to little cultivation of a
literary sort; but she could write, as Miss Stebbins proves, excellent
letters, now grave, now gay, now reflective, now descriptive, always
interesting, and altogether remarkable for sound sense and for force and
skill of expression. Her death was regarded in America almost as a
national catastrophe. As Miss Stebbins writes, "The press of the entire
country bore witness to her greatness, and laid their tributes upon her
tomb."</p>

</div>

<p>It is told that Rachel Felix was born on March 24, 1821, at Munf, near
the town of Aarau, in the Canton of Aargau, Switzerland; the burgomaster
of the district simply noting in his books that upon the day stated, at
the little village inn, the wife of a poor pedler had given birth to a
female child. The entry included no mention of family, name, or
religion, and otherwise the event was not registered in any civil or
religious record. The father and mother were Abraham Felix, a Jew, born
in Metz, but of German origin, and Esther Haya, his wife. They had
wandered about the continent during many years, seeking a living and
scarcely finding it. Several children were born to them by the wayside,
as it were, on their journeyings hither and thither: Sarah in Germany,
Rebecca in Lyons, Dinah in Paris, Rachel in Switzerland; and there were
other infants who did not long survive their birth, succumbing to the
austerities of the state of life to which they had been called. For a
time, perhaps because of their numerous progeny, M. and Madame Felix
settled in Lyons. Madame Felix opened a small shop and dealt in
second-hand clothes; M. Felix gave lessons in German to the very few
pupils he could obtain. About 1830 the family moved to Paris. They were
still miserably poor. The children Sarah and Rachel, usually carrying a
smaller child in their arms or wheeling it with them in a wooden cart,
were sent into the streets to earn money by singing at the doors of
cafes and estaminets. A musical amateur, one M. Morin, noticed the
girls, questioned them, interested himself about them, and finally
obtained their admission into the Government School of Sacred Music in
the Rue Vaugirard. Rachel's voice did not promise much, however; as she
confessed, she could not sing&mdash;she could only recite. She had received
but the scantiest and meanest education; she read with difficulty; she
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page364" name="page364"></a>(p. 364)</span> was teaching herself writing by copying the manuscript of
others. Presently she was studying elocution under M. St. Aulaire, an
old actor retired from the Français, who took pains with the child,
instructing her gratuitously and calling her "ma petite diablesse." The
performances of M. St. Aulaire's pupil were occasionally witnessed by
the established players, among them Monval of the Gymnase and Samson of
the Comédie. Monval approved and encouraged the young actress, and upon
the recommendation of Samson she entered the classes of the
Conservatoire, over which he presided, with Michelot and Provost as his
co-professors.</p>

<p>At the Conservatoire Rachel made little progress. All her efforts failed
to win the good opinion of her preceptors. In despair she resolved to
abandon altogether the institution, its classes and performances. She
felt herself neglected, aggrieved, insulted. "Tartuffe" had been
announced for representation by the pupils; she had been assigned the
mute part of Flipote, the serving-maid, who simply appears upon the
scene in the first act that her ears may be soundly boxed by Madame
Pernelle. To this humiliation she would not submit. She hurried to her
old friend, St. Aulaire, who consulted Monval, who commended her to his
manager, M. Poirson. She entered into an engagement to serve the Gymnase
for a term of three years upon a salary of 3,000 francs. M. Poirson was
quick to perceive that she was not as so many other beginners were; that
there was something new and startling about the young actress. He
obtained for her first appearance, from M. Paul Duport, a little
melodrama in two acts. It was called "La Vendéenne," and owed its more
striking scenes to "The Heart of Midlothian." After the manner of Jeanie
Deans, Géneviève, the heroine of the play, footsore and travel-stained,
seeks the presence of the Empress Josephine to implore the pardon of a
Vendéan peasant condemned to death for following George Cadoudal. "La
Vendéenne," produced on April 24, 1837, and received with great
applause, was played on sixty successive nights, but not to very crowded
audiences. The press scarcely noticed the new actress. The critic of the
<i>Journal des Débats</i>, however, while rashly affirming that Rachel was
not a phenomenon and would never be extolled as a wonder, carefully
noted certain of the merits and characteristics of her performance. "She
was an unskilled child, but she possessed heart, soul, intellect. There
was something bold, abrupt, uncouth about her aspect, gait, and manner.
She was dressed simply and truthfully in the coarse woollen gown of a
peasant-girl; her hands were red; her voice was harsh and untrained, but
powerful; she acted without effort or exaggeration; she did not scream
or gesticulate unduly; she seemed to perceive intuitively the feeling
she was required to express, and could interest the audience greatly,
moving them to tears. She was not pretty, but she pleased," etc. Bouffé,
who witnessed this representation, observed: "What an odd little girl!
Assuredly there is something in her. But her place is not here." So
judged Samson also, becoming more and more aware of the merits of his
former pupil. She was transferred to the Français to play the leading
characters in tragedy, at a salary of 4,000 francs a year. M. Poirson
did not hesitate to cancel her agreement <span class="pagenum"><a id="page365" name="page365"></a>(p. 365)</span> with him. Indeed, he
had been troubled with thinking how he could employ his new actress. She
was not an <i>ingénue</i> of the ordinary type; she could not be classed
among soubrettes. There were no parts suited to her in the light
comedies of Scribe and his compeers, which constituted the chief
repertory of the Gymnase.</p>

<p>It was on June 12, 1838, that Rachel, as Camille, in "Horace," made her
first appearance upon the stage of the Théâtre Français. The receipts
were but seven hundred and fifty francs; it was an unfashionable period
of the year; Paris was out of town; the weather was most sultry. There
were many Jews in the house, it was said, resolute to support the
daughter of Israel, and her success was unequivocal; nevertheless, a
large share of the applause of the night was confessedly carried off by
the veteran Joanny, who played Horace. On June 16th Rachel made her
second appearance, personating Emilie in the "Cinna," of Corneille. The
receipts fell to five hundred and fifty francs. She repeated her
performance of Camille on the 23d; the receipts were only three hundred
francs! the poorest house, perhaps, she ever played to in Paris. She
afterward appeared as Hermione in "Andromaque," Aménaide in "Tancrède,"
Eriphile in "Iphigénie," Monime in "Mithridate," and Roxane in
"Bajazet," the receipts now gradually rising, until, in October, when
she played Hermione for the tenth time, six thousand francs were taken
at the doors, an equal amount being received in November, when, for the
sixth time, she appeared as Camille. Paris was now at her feet. In 1839,
called upon to play two or three times per week, she essayed but one new
part, Esther, in Racine's tragedy of that name. The public was quite
content that she should assume again and again the characters in which
she had already triumphed. In 1840 she added to her list of
impersonations Laodie and Pauline in Corneille's "Nicomède" and
"Polyeucte," and Marie Stuart in Lebrun's tragedy. In 1841 she played no
new parts. In 1842 she first appeared as Chimène in "Le Cid," as Ariane,
and as Frédégonde in a wretched tragedy by Le Mercier.</p>

<p>Rachel had saved the Théâtre Français, had given back to the stage the
masterpieces of the French classical drama. It was very well for
Thackeray to write from Paris in 1839 that the actress had "only
galvanized the corpse, not revivified.... Racine will never come to life
again and cause audiences to weep as of yore." He predicted: "Ancient
French tragedy, red-heeled, patched, and beperiwigged, lies in the
grave, and it is only the ghost of it that the fair Jewess has raised."
But it was something more than a galvanized animation that Rachel had
imparted to the old drama of France. During her career of twenty years,
her performances of Racine and Corneille filled the coffers of the
Français, and it may be traced to her influence and example that the
classic plays still keep their place upon the stage and stir the
ambition of the players. But now the committee of the Français had to
reckon with their leading actress, and pay the price of the prosperity
she had brought them. They cancelled her engagement and offered her
terms such as seemed to them liberal beyond all precedent. But the more
they offered, so much the more was demanded. In the first instance, the
actress being a minor, negotiations were carried on with her father, the
committee <span class="pagenum"><a id="page366" name="page366"></a>(p. 366)</span> denouncing in the bitterest terms the avarice and
rapacity of M. Felix. But when Rachel became competent to deal on her
own behalf, she proved herself every whit as exacting as her sire. She
became a <i>sociétaire</i> in 1843, entitled to one of the twenty-four shares
into which the profits of the institution were divided. She was
rewarded, moreover, with a salary of forty-two thousand francs per
annum; and it was estimated that by her performances during her <i>congé</i>
of three or four months every year she earned a further annual income of
thirty thousand francs. She met with extraordinary success upon her
provincial tours; enormous profits resulted from her repeated visits to
Holland and Belgium, Germany, Russia, and England. But, from first to
last, Rachel's connection with the Français was an incessant quarrel.
She was capricious, ungrateful, unscrupulous, extortionate. She
struggled to evade her duties, to do as little as she possibly could in
return for the large sums she received from the committee. She pretended
to be too ill to play in Paris, the while she was always well enough to
hurry away and obtain great rewards by her performances in the
provinces. She wore herself out by her endless wanderings hither and
thither, her continuous efforts upon the scene. She denied herself all
rest, or slept in a travelling carriage to save time in her passage from
one country theatre to another. Her company complained that they fell
asleep as they acted, her engagements denying them proper opportunities
of repose. The newspapers at one time set forth the acrimonious letters
she had interchanged with the committee of the Français. Finally she
tended her resignation of the position she occupied as <i>sociétaire</i>; the
committee took legal proceedings to compel her to return to her duties;
some concessions were made on either side, however, and a reconciliation
was patched up.</p>

<p>The new tragedies, "Judith" and "Cléopatre," written for the actress by
Madame de Girardin, failed to please, nor did success attend the
production of M. Romand's "Catherine II.," M. Soumet's "Jeanne d'Arc,"
in which, to the indignation of the critics, the heroine was seen at
last surrounded by real flames! or "Le Vieux de la Montagne" of M.
Latour de St. Ybars. With better fortune Rachel appeared in the same
author's "Virginie," and in the "Lucrèce" of Ponsard. Voltaire's
"Oreste" was revived for her in 1845 that she might play Electre. She
personated Racine's "Athalie" in 1847, assuming long white locks,
painting furrows on her face, and disguising herself beyond recognition,
in her determination to seem completely the character she had
undertaken. In 1848 she played Agrippine in the "Britannicus" of Racine,
and dressed in plain white muslin, and clasping the tri-colored flag to
her heart, she delivered the "Marseillaise" to please the
Revolutionists, lending the air strange meaning and passion by the
intensity of her manner, as she half chanted, half recited the words,
her voice now shrill and harsh, now deep, hollow, and reverberating&mdash;her
enraptured auditors likening it in effect to distant thunder.</p>

<p>To the dramatists who sought to supply her with new parts, Rachel was
the occasion of much chagrin and perplexity. After accepting Scribe's
"Adrienne Lecouvreur" she rejected it absolutely only to resume it
eagerly, however, when she learned that the leading character was to be
undertaken by Mademoiselle <span class="pagenum"><a id="page367" name="page367"></a>(p. 367)</span> Rose Chéri. His "Chandelier" having
met with success, Rachel applied to De Musset for a play. She was
offered, it seems, "Les Caprices de Marianne," but meantime the poet's
"Bettine" failed, and the actress distrustfully turned away from him. An
undertaking to appear in the "Medea" of Legouvé landed her in a
protracted lawsuit. The courts condemned her in damages to the amount of
two hundred francs for every day she delayed playing the part of Medea
after the date fixed upon by the management for the commencement of the
rehearsals of the tragedy. She paid nothing, however, for the management
failed to fix any such date. M. Legouvé was only avenged in the success
his play obtained, in a translated form, at the hands of Madame Ristori.
In lieu of "Medea" Rachel produced "Rosemonde," a tragedy by M. Latour
de St. Ybars, which failed completely. Other plays written for her were
the "Valéria" of MM. Lacroix and Maquet, in which she personated two
characters&mdash;the Empress Messalina and her half sister, Lysisca, a
courtesan; the "Diane," of M. Augier, an imitation of Victor Hugo's
"Marion Delorme;" "Lady Tartuffe," a comedy by Madame de Girardin; and
"La Czarine," by M. Scribe. She appeared also in certain of the
characters originally contrived for Mademoiselle Mais, such as La Tisbe
in Victor Hugo's "Angelo," and the heroines of Dumas's "Mademoiselle de
Belle Isle" and of "Louise de Lignerolles" by MM. Legouvé and Dinaux.</p>

<p>The classical drama of France has not found much favor in England and
America. We are all, perhaps, apt to think with Thackeray
disrespectfully of the "old tragedies&mdash;well-nigh dead, and full time
too&mdash;in which half a dozen characters appear and shout sonorous
Alexandrines for half a dozen hours;" or we are disposed to agree with
Mr. Matthew Arnold, that their drama, being fundamentally insufficient
both in substance and in form, the French, with all their gifts, have
not, as we have, an adequate form for poetry of the highest class. Those
who remember Rachel, however, can testify that she breathed the most
ardent life into the frigid remains of Racine and Corneille, relumed
them with Promethean heat, and showed them to be instinct with the
truest and intensest passion&mdash;When she occupied the scene, there could
be no thought of the old artificial times of hair powder and rouge,
periwigs and patches, in connection with the characters she represented.
Phèdre and Hermione, Pauline and Camille, interpreted by her genius,
became as real and natural, warm and palpitating, as Constance or Lady
Macbeth could have been when played by Mrs. Siddons, or as Juliet when
impersonated by Miss O'Neill. Before Rachel came, it had been thought
that the new romantic drama of MM. Hugo and Dumas, because of its
greater truth to nature, had given the <i>coup de grâce</i> to the old
classic plays; but the public, at her bidding, turned gladly from the
spasms and the rant of "Angelo" and "Angèle," "Antony" and "Hernani," to
the old-world stories, the formal tragedies of the seventeenth century
poet-dramatists of France. The actress fairly witched her public. There
was something of magic in her very presence upon the scene.</p>

<p>None could fail to be impressed by the aspect of the slight, pallid
woman who <span class="pagenum"><a id="page368" name="page368"></a>(p. 368)</span> seemed to gain height by reason of her slenderness,
who moved toward her audience with such simple natural majesty, who wore
and conducted her fluent classical draperies with such admirable and
perfect grace. It was as though she had lived always so attired in
tunic, peplum, and pallium&mdash;had known no other dress&mdash;not that she was
of modern times playing at antiquity, she was the muse of Greek tragedy
in person. The physical traditions of her race found expression or
incarnation in her. Her face was of refined Judaical character&mdash;the thin
nose slightly curved, the lower lip a trifle full, but the mouth
exquisitely shaped, and the teeth small, white, and even. The profuse
black-brown hair was smoothed and braided from the broad, low, white,
somewhat over-hanging brow, beneath which in shadow the keen black eyes
flashed out their lightnings, or glowed luridly like coals at a red
heat. Her gestures were remarkable for their dignity and
appropriateness; the long, slight arms lent themselves surprisingly to
gracefulness; the beautifully formed hands, with the thin tapering
fingers and the pink filbert nails, seemed always tremblingly on the
alert to add significance or accent to her speeches. But there was
eloquence in her very silence and complete repose. She could relate a
whole history by her changes of facial expression. She possessed special
powers of self-control; she was under subjection to both art and nature
when she seemed to abandon herself the most absolutely to the whirlwind
of her passion. There were no undue excesses of posture, movement, or
tone. Her attitudes, it was once said, were those of "a Pythoness cast
in bronze." Her voice thrilled and awed at its first note: it was so
strangely deep, so solemnly melodious, until, stirred by passion as it
were, it became thick and husky in certain of its tones; but it was
always audible, articulate, and telling, whether sunk to a whisper or
raised clamorously. Her declamation was superb, if, as critics reported,
there had been decline in this matter during those later years of her
life, to which my own acquaintance with Rachel's acting is confined. I
saw her first at the Français in 1849, and I was present at her last
performance at the St. James' Theatre in 1853, having in the interval
witnessed her assumption of certain of her most admired characters. And
it may be true, too, that, like Kean, she was more and more disposed, as
the years passed, to make "points," to slur over the less important
scenes, and reserve herself for a grand outburst or a vehement climax,
sacrificing thus many of the subtler graces, refinements, and
graduations of elocution, for which she had once been famous. To English
ears, it was hardly an offence that she broke up the sing-song of the
rhymed tirades of the old plays and gave them a more natural sound,
regardless of the traditional methods of speech of Clairon, Le Kain, and
others of the great French players of the past.</p>

<p>Rachel as the Muse of Greek Tragedy.</p>
</div>

<p>Less success than had been looked for attended Rachel's invasion of the
repertory of Mlle. Mars, an actress so idolized by the Parisians that
her sixty years and great portliness of form were not thought hindrances
to her personation of the youthful heroines of modern comedy and drama.
But Rachel's fittest occupation and her greatest triumphs were found in
the classical poetic plays. She, perhaps, intellectualized too much the
creations of Hugo, Dumas, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page369" name="page369"></a>(p. 369)</span> Scribe; gave them excess of
majesty. Her histrionic style was too exalted an ideal for the
conventional characters of the drama of her own time; it was even said
of her that she could not speak its prose properly or tolerably. She
disliked the hair-powder necessary to Adrienne Lecouvreur and Gabrielle
de Belle Isle, although her beauty, for all its severity, did not lose
picturesqueness in the costumes of the time of Louis XV. As Gabrielle
she was more girlish and gentle, pathetic, and tender, than was her
wont, while the signal fervor of her speech addressed to Richelieu,
beginning, "Vous mentez, Monsieur le Duc," stirred the audience to the
most excited applause.</p>

<p>Rachel was seen upon the stage for the last time at Charleston on
December 17, 1856. She played Adrienne Lecouvreur. She had been tempted
to America by the prospect of extravagant profits. It had been dinned
into her ears that Jenny Lind, by thirty-eight performances in America,
had realized seventeen hundred thousand francs. Why might not she,
Rachel, receive as much? And then, she was eager to quit Paris. There
had been strange worship there of Madame Ristori, even in the rejected
part of Medea. But already Rachel's health was in a deplorable state.
Her constitution, never very strong, had suffered severely from the
cruel fatigues, the incessant exertions, she had undergone. It may be,
too, that the deprivations and sufferings of her childhood now made
themselves felt as over-due claims that could be no longer denied or
deferred. She forced herself to play, in fulfilment of her engagement,
but she was languid, weak, emaciated; she coughed incessantly, her
strength was gone; she was dying slowly but certainly of phthisis. And
she appeared before an audience that applauded her, it is true, but
cared nothing for Racine and Corneille, knew little of the French
language, and were urgent that she should sing the "Marseillaise" as she
had sung it in 1848! It was forgotten, or it was not known in America,
that the actress had long since renounced revolutionary sentiments to
espouse the cause of the Second Empire. She performed all her more
important characters, however, at New York, Philadelphia, and Boston.
Nor was the undertaking commercially disappointing, if it did not wholly
satisfy expectation. She returned to France possessed of nearly three
hundred thousand francs as her share of the profits of her forty-two
performances in the United States; but she returned to die. The winter
of 1856 she passed at Cairo. She returned to France in the spring of
1857, but her physicians forbade her to remain long in Paris. In
September she moved again to the South, finding her last retreat in the
villa Sardou, at Cannet, a little village in the environs of Cannes. She
lingered to January 3, 1858. The Théâtre Français closed its doors when
news arrived of her death, and again on the day of her funeral. The body
was embalmed and brought to Paris for interment in the cemetery of Père
la Chaise, the obsequies being performed in accordance with the Jewish
rites. The most eminent of the authors and actors of France were
present, and funeral orations were delivered by MM. Jules Janin,
Bataille, and Auguste Maquet. Victor Hugo was in exile; or, as Janin
announced, the author of "Angelo" would not have withheld the tribute
of his eulogy upon the sad occasion.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<p>The great actor who has lately left the world furnished, in his own
remarkable character and shining career, a striking exception to the
popular tradition that men of genius are the fathers of ordinary sons.
The father of Edwin Booth was in his time one of the glories of the
English and American stage; but, even in his case the strict rule
wavered, for his father, though not a genius, was yet a man of
exceptional character; one who marked out a clear path for himself in
the world, and walked in it to the end.</p>

<p>How far back the line of the family can be traced, or what was its
origin, we do not know; but it has lately been said that the family was
of Hebrew extraction, and came into England from Spain, where it had
been known by the Spanish name, Cabana. The branch of the family that
left Spain to live in England translated the name into the language of
their new home, and from "Cabana," a shepherd's cabin, made the English
equivalent, Booth.</p>

<p>However it may have been in this case, it was quite in the order of
things that this change of name should be made. It has been done
everywhere in Europe since very early times, and is doing to-day in this
country by new comers from all parts of the old world.</p>

<p>The first of the Booths we read of in England was a silversmith, living
in Bloomsbury, London, in the latter half of the last century. He had a
son, Richard, who was bred to the law, but who was so imbued with the
republican ideas rife at the time that he actually came to America to
fight in the cause of Independence! He was taken prisoner, and carried
back to England, where, not without some struggles, he again applied
himself to the practice of the law, and in time made a fortune. He did
not, however, forget America, and we are told that he had, hanging in
his house, a portrait of Washington, which he expected all his visitors
to salute.</p>

<p>One of the ways in which the republicans of that time showed where their
sympathies lay, was in naming their children after the heroes of Greece
and Rome; and accordingly we find Richard Booth calling his eldest son,
Junius Brutus <span class="pagenum"><a id="page371" name="page371"></a>(p. 371)</span> Booth, after the Roman patriot. This son was born
in London, in 1796. His father was a man of scholarly tastes, and gave
the boy a classical education, but it was long before he showed a marked
inclination for any particular walk in life. He tried his hand at
painting, sculpture, and poetry; and for a while studied law with his
father. But, when the time came to choose, he gave his voice for the
navy, and would have joined the brig Boxer, then fitting out for Nova
Scotia. But, as war threatened between England and America, he was
induced, by the strong persuasions of his father, not to run the risk of
being forced to fight against America. He then decided to go upon the
stage, and, in spite of his father's remonstrances, carried out his
purpose. After some unimportant essays he at last succeeded in
attracting public attention, and before long showed such unmistakable
ability in dealing with difficult parts, that the public, till that time
undivided in its enthusiasm for Kean, awoke to the fact that a dangerous
rival threatened the security of their idol's throne. In the midst of
his successes, however, Booth married and left England with his wife for
a honeymoon trip to the West Indies. He had intended to return at once
to England, but he was persuaded to prolong his journey and to visit New
York. After playing a successful engagement there he went to Richmond,
where he was no less prosperous. He next visited New Orleans and
acquired such facility in speaking French that he played parts in French
plays more than acceptably, and distinguished himself by acting Orestes
in Racine's "Andromaque," to the delight of the French-speaking
population. His accent is said to have been remarkable for its purity.
Returning to New York, he acted Othello to Forrest's Iago; but, in the
midst of his successes, the death of two of his children produced a
temporary insanity, and this was made worse by the news of the death of
his favorite son, Henry Byron, in London, of small-pox. This grievous
loss was, however, to be made up to him by his son, Edwin, in whom he
was to find the counterpart of himself, softened, refined, ennobled,
while between father and son was to grow a strong attachment, a bond of
mutual affection to last as long as life should endure.</p>

<p>Edwin Thomas Booth was born at Bel Air, Maryland, November 12, 1833. He
was named Edwin, after his father's friend, Edwin Forrest, and Thomas,
after Thomas Flynn, the actor, whom the elder Booth had known intimately
in London. His son dropped the name of Thomas, later in life, and was
only known to the public by the name of Edwin Booth. Owing to his
father's wandering life Edwin had few advantages of education, but he
made the most of his opportunities, and indeed was a student of good
letters all his life, turning the light of all he learned from books and
experience upon his art. His youth is described as reticent, and marked
by a strong individuality, with a deep sympathy for his father, early
manifested; his father, a much enduring, suffering man, strongly in need
of sympathy, knowing to repay it, too, in kind.</p>

<p>Edwin Booth made his first appearance on the stage in 1849 at the Boston
Museum in the youthful part of Tressil, in Colley Cibber's version of
Shakespeare's "Richard III." It had been against his father's wishes
that he had adopted the stage as a profession; but, as his father had
done in a like case before him <span class="pagenum"><a id="page372" name="page372"></a>(p. 372)</span> he persevered, and soon had the
satisfaction of convincing his parent that he had decided wisely. He did
not at once come to New York after his success in Boston, but went to
Providence and to Philadelphia, acting Cassio in "Othello," and Wilford
in the "Iron Chest," a part he soon made his own and in which he made
his first appearance in New York, playing at the National Theatre in
Chatham Street, in 1850. The next year he played Richard III. for the
first time, taking the part unexpectedly to fill the place of his
father, who was suddenly ill. In 1852 he went out with his father to San
Francisco, where his brother, Junius Brutus Booth, Jr., was the manager
of a theatre; and the father and his two sons acted together. At
Sacramento, we are told that the incident occurred which led Edwin Booth
to think of acting Hamlet, a part which was to become as closely
associated with his name as that of Richard III. was with his father. He
was dressed for the part of Jaffier in Otway's play, "Venice Preserved,"
when some one said to him "You look like Hamlet, why not play it?" It
was, however, some time before he ventured to assume the part. In
October, 1852, the father and son parted, not to meet again. The elder
Booth went to New Orleans, and after playing for a week took passage in
a steamboat on the Mississippi, and catching a severe cold succumbed
after a few days' illness and died. For a while after his father's death
Edwin suffered greatly from poverty and from the hardships of his
precarious life, unsustained as he now was by the affection and
encouragement of a father who, with all his faults, and in all the
misfortunes brought on by serious ill-health and some aberrations that
were the effect of ill-health had always been an affectionate and true
friend. But a talent such as Edwin Booth possessed, united to a high
character, and to a dauntless spirit, could not long be hid, and in a
short time his name began to be heard of as that of one destined to
great ends. In 1854 he went to Australia as a member of Laura Keene's
company. He had made a deep impression in California, acting such parts
as Richard III., Shylock, Macbeth, and Hamlet, and on returning there
from Australia that first impression was greatly strengthened. On
leaving San Francisco he received various testimonials showing the high
esteem in which his acting was held by the educated part of the
community; but throughout Edwin Booth's career, the interest he excited
in the vast audiences that followed him was by no means confined to the
self-styled "best people." Though he never "played to the gallery," the
heart of the gallery was as much with him as the heart of the boxes, and
he knew the value of its rapt silence as well as of its stormy voices.</p>

<p>In Boston, in 1857, he played Sir Giles Overreach, in Massinger's "A New
Way to Pay Old Debts," and the profound impression he made in it
confirmed him in his purpose to devote himself to tragic acting. The
story of an actor's life is seldom eventful, and Mr. Booth's history,
after his first assured success, is the record of a long line of
triumphs without a failure. The most remarkable of these triumphs was at
the Winter Garden Theatre in New York, where he acted Hamlet to large
and ever-increasing audiences for over one hundred successive nights,
that is, from November 21, 1864, to March 24, 1865. On this <span class="pagenum"><a id="page373" name="page373"></a>(p. 373)</span>
occasion a gold medal was presented to the actor by friends and admirers
in New York; the list of subscribers including the names of many
well-known citizens. The Winter Garden Theatre was managed by Booth and
his brother-in-law, the clever actor, J. S. Clarke, until Booth bought
out Clarke and assumed the entire management himself. In 1865 the
terrible tragedy occurred which blighted Booth's whole after-life, and
for a time drove him from the stage. He did not act again until 1866; in
1867 the theatre was destroyed by fire, and in 1868 the corner-stone of
a new building, to be known as Booth's Theatre, was laid, and in a short
time New York was in possession, for the first time, of a thoroughly
appointed, comfortable, and handsome theatre. This building was made
famous by a number of Shakespearian revivals that for beauty,
magnificence, and scenic poetry have, we believe, never been equalled.
We doubt if "Hamlet," "Julius Cæsar," or "Romeo and Juliet," have ever
been presented with more satisfying completeness to the eye and to the
imagination than in this theatre by Mr. Booth and his company. Although
the theatre was in existence for thirteen years, from 1868 to 1882, when
it was finally closed, Mr. Booth's management lasted only about half
that time. The speculation was not a fortunate one for the actor; the
expenses ate up all the profits, and Mr. Booth was bankrupted by his
venture. He paid all his debts, however, and went bravely to work to
build up a new fortune. He made a tour of the South, which was one long
ovation, and in a season of eight weeks in San Francisco he took in
$96,000.</p>

<p>In 1880 he went to England and remained there two years. In 1882 he
visited Germany, acting in both countries with great success, and in
1883 he returned home and made a tour of America, repeating everywhere
his old triumphs, and winning golden opinions from all classes of his
countrymen.</p>

<p>Edwin Booth died in New York, June 7, 1893, at the Players' Club, where
he had lived for the last few years of his life. This was a building
erected by his own munificence, fitted up with luxurious completeness,
and presented to a society of his professional brethren for the use and
behoof of his fellow-artists, reserving for himself only the modest
apartment where he chose to live, in sympathetic touch with those who
still pursued the noble art he had relinquished.</p>

<p>Mr. Booth was twice married. By his first wife, Miss Mary Devlin, who
died in 1863, he had one child, a daughter; by the second, Miss
McVicker, he had no children. She died in 1881.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

</div>

<p>Joseph Jefferson, distinguished, among his other brilliant successes as
an actor, as the creator for this generation of the character of Rip Van
Winkle in the play dramatized from the story in Washington Irving's
"Sketch Book," was the third of his name in a family of actors. The
first of the three was born at Plymouth, England, in 1774. He was the
son of Thomas Jefferson, a comedian of merit, the contemporary and
friend of Garrick, and came to this country in 1795, making his first
appearance in New York on February 10, 1796, in the part of Squire
Richard in "The Provoked Husband." Dunlap says that, young as he was, he
was already an artist, and that among the men of the company he held the
first place. He lived in this country for thirty-six years, admired as
an actor and respected as a man. He died at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in
1832.</p>

<p>Joseph Jefferson, the second, was born in Philadelphia in 1804. He
inherited the laughing blue eyes and sunny disposition of his father,
but he had not his talent as an actor; he is said to have been best in
old men's parts. His taste, however, led him to scene-painting rather
than to acting; yet his skill in either direction was not enough to win
success, and, in spite of well-meant efforts, he lived and died a poor
man: ill luck pursuing him to the end of his days, when he was carried
off by yellow fever at Mobile in 1842, just as his unprosperous skies
were brightening a little. His son bears affectionate witness to the
upright character of the man and to his indomitable cheerfulness in the
most adverse circumstances. He spared no pains in bringing up his
children in good ways, and he was earnestly seconded by his wife, a
heroic figure in her humble sphere, whose tact and courage not seldom
saved the family bark when it was drifting in shoal water. Mrs.
Jefferson came of French parents, and was a Mrs. Burke, a widow with one
child, a son, when she married Mr. Jefferson. Her son tells us that she
had been one of the most attractive stars in America, the leading prima
donna of the country; but she bore her changed fortune, as the wife of
an unsuccessful actor and manager, with no less dignity on the stage of
real life, where no applause was to be had but what came from those who
loved her as mother, wife, and friend.</p>

<p>This, then, was the family circle in which our Joseph Jefferson passed
his <span class="pagenum"><a id="page375" name="page375"></a>(p. 375)</span> earliest years, the formative period of his life. There
were the kind-hearted, easy-going father, the practical, energetic
mother, a sister, and the half-brother, Charles Burke, whose
after-reputation as an actor lives in the pages of Jefferson's
autobiography enshrined in words of warm but judicious appreciation.
"Although only a half-brother," says Jefferson, "he seemed like a father
to me, and there was a deep and strange affection between us." Nor must
mention be forgotten of one other member of the family: Mary, his
foster-mother, as Jefferson affectionately calls her, "a faithful,
loving, truthful friend, rather than a servant, with no ambition or
thought for herself, living only for us, and totally unconscious of her
own existence."</p>

<p>Joseph Jefferson, the third of the name, and in whom the talent of his
grandfather was to reappear enriched with added graces of his own, was
born in Philadelphia in 1829. He tells us that his earliest
recollections are connected with a theatre in Washington. This was a
rickety, old, frame-building adjoining the house in which his father
lived as manager, the door at the end of the hall-way opening directly
upon the stage; and as a toddling little chap in a short frock he was
allowed full run of the place. Thus "behind the scenes" was his first
playground; and here, "in this huge and dusty toy-shop made for children
of a larger growth," he got his first experience. He was early
accustomed to face an audience; for, being the son of the manager and
almost living in the theatre, he was always pressed into the service
whenever a small child was wanted, and "often went on the stage in long
clothes as a property infant in groups of happy peasantry." His first
dim recollection of such a public appearance is as the "child," in
Kotzebue's play, "Pizarro," who is carried across the bridge by Rolla.
His next appearance was in a new entertainment, called "Living Statues,"
where he struck attitudes as "Ajax Defying the Lightning," or "The Dying
Gladiator." At four years of age he made a hit by accompanying T. D.
Rice, the original "Jim Crow," as a miniature copy of that once famous
character, and the first money he earned was the sum of $24 thrown upon
the stage in silver from pit and gallery, to reward his childish dancing
and singing on that occasion.</p>

<p>Thus early wedded to the stage, Jefferson followed the fortunes of his
family, and led with them a wandering life for many years, growing, by
slow degrees and constant, varied practice, to the perfection of his
prime. In 1838 his father led the flock to Chicago, just then grown from
an Indian village to a thriving place of two thousand inhabitants, where
he was to join his brother in the management of a new theatre, then
building. Jefferson's account of the journey is a striking picture, at
once amusing and pathetic, of the changes that have been wrought by
fifty years. The real privations and hardships of the trip are veiled in
the actor's story by his quiet humor and his disposition to see
everything in a cheerful light. Always quizzing his own youthful
follies, he cannot conceal from us by any mischievous anecdotes his
essential goodness of nature, his merry helpfulness, his unselfish
devotion to the welfare of the others, or the pluck with which he met
the accidents of this itinerant life. From Chicago, where their success
was not brilliant, the family went by stage to Springfield, where, by a
singular <span class="pagenum"><a id="page376" name="page376"></a>(p. 376)</span> chance, they were rescued from the danger that
threatened them in the closing of the theatre by a municipal law trumped
up in the interest of religious revivalists, by the adroitness of a
young lawyer, who proved to be none other than Abraham Lincoln. In
Memphis, when bad business had closed the theatre, young Jefferson's
pluck and ready wit saved the family purse from absolute collapse. A
city ordinance had been passed, requiring that all carts, drays, and
public vehicles should be numbered; and the boy, hearing of this, called
at the mayor's office, and, explaining the situation that had obliged
his father to exchange acting for sign-painting, applied in his name for
the contract for painting the numbers&mdash;and obtained it! The new industry
furnished father and son with a month's work, and some jobs at
sign-painting helped still further to make life easier.</p>

<p>From Memphis the family went to Mobile, where they hoped to rest after
their long wanderings, and where it was also hoped the children, Joseph
and his sister, might be put to school. But the yellow fever was raging
in Mobile, and they had been in the city only a fortnight when Mr.
Jefferson was attacked by the disease and died. In Mobile, too, the good
Mary died, and Mrs. Jefferson was left alone to care for herself and her
children as she could. She had no longer a heart for acting, and she
decided to open a boarding-house for actors, while Joseph and his sister
earned a small stipend by variety work in the theatre.</p>

<p>More years of hardship followed&mdash;the trio of mother and children
wandering over the country, south and west: in Mississippi and Mexico,
seeing life in all its phases of ill luck and disappointment, with faint
gleams of success here and there, but meeting all with a spirit of such
cheerful bravery as makes the darkest experience yield a pleasure in the
telling. Surely, it might soften the heart of the sourest enemy of the
stage to read the spirit in which this family met the long-continued
crosses of their professional life.</p>

<p>Joe Jefferson as Bob Acres.</p>
</div>

<p>Joseph Jefferson tells the story of his career so modestly, that it is
hard to discover just when it was that success first began to turn a
smiling face upon his efforts. Yet it would seem as if, for himself, the
day broke when he created the part of Asa Trenchard in "Our American
Cousin." He says that up to 1858, when he acted that part, he had been
always more or less a "legitimate" actor, that is, one who has his place
with others in a stock company, and never thinks of himself as an
individual and single attraction&mdash;a star, as it is called. While engaged
with this part, it suddenly occurred to him that in acting Asa Trenchard
he had, for the first time in his life on the stage, spoken a pathetic
speech; up to that time all with him had been pure comedy. Now he had
found a part in which he could move his audience to tears as well as
smiles. This was to him a delightful discovery, and he looked about for
a new part in which he could repeat the experiment. One day in summer,
as he lay in the loft of a barn reading in a book he well calls
delightful, Pierre Irving's "Life and Letters of Washington Irving," he
learned that the great writer had seen him act the part of Goldfinch, in
Holcroft's "Road to Ruin," and that he reminded him of his grandfather,
Joseph Jefferson, "in look, gesture, size, and make." Naturally pleased
to find <span class="pagenum"><a id="page377" name="page377"></a>(p. 377)</span> himself remembered and written of by such a man, he
lay musing on the compliment, when the "Sketch Book" and the story of
Rip van Winkle came suddenly into his mind. "There was to me," he
writes, "magic in the sound of the name as I repeated it. Why was not
this the very character I wanted? An American story by an American
author was surely just the thing suited to an American actor."</p>

<p>There had been three or four plays founded on this story, but Jefferson
says that none of them were good. His father and his half-brother had
acted the part before him, but nothing that he remembered gave him any
hope that he could make a good play out of existing material. He
therefore went to work to construct a play for himself, and his story of
how he did it, told in two pages of his book, and with the most
unconscious air in the world, reveals the whole secret of Jefferson's
acting: its humor and pathos subtly mingled, its deep humanity, its pure
poetry&mdash;the assemblage of qualities, in fine, that make it the most
perfect as well as the most original product of the American stage.</p>

<p>Yet the play, even in the form he gave it, did not satisfy him, nor did
it make the impression in America that he desired. It was not until five
years later that Dion Boucicault, in London, remade it for Jefferson;
and it was in that city it first saw the light in its new form,
September 5, 1865. It was at once successful, and had a run of one
hundred and seventy-five nights.</p>

<p>With his Asa Trenchard and his Rip van Winkle will ever be associated in
the loving memory of play-goers his Bob Acres in Sheridan's "Rivals,"
thought by many to be his capital part&mdash;a personification where all the
foibles of the would-be man-of-the-world: his self-conceit, his brag,
his cowardice, are transformed into virtues and captivate our hearts,
dissolved in the brimming humor which yet never overflows the just
measure, so degenerating into farce.</p>

<p>Between the two productions of Rip van Winkle in New York and in London,
Jefferson had had many strange experiences. His wife died in 1861, and
he broke up his household in New York, and leaving three of his children
at school in that city, he left home with his eldest son and went to
California. After acting in San Francisco, he sailed for Australia,
where he was warmly received; thence went to the other British colonies
in that region, touched on his return at Lima and Callao and Panama, at
which place he took a sailing-packet for London, and after his great
success in that city returned to America in 1866. In 1867 he married, in
Chicago, Miss Sarah Warren, and since that time his life has flowed on
in an even stream, happy in all its relations, private and public,
crowned with honors, not of a gaudy or brilliant kind, but solid and
enduring. His art is henceforth part and parcel of the rich treasure of
the American stage.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

</div>

<p>A consensus of opinion places this distinguished artiste at the head of
all her compeers, for it may be truly said that she is the brightest
star which has dazzled the musical firmament during the past half
century, and, is still in the very zenith of her noonday splendor.</p>

<p>Regardful of the transcendent beauty of her voice, enhanced as this is
by her other natural and attractive attributes, one might almost believe
that nightingales have surrounded the cradle presided over by Euterpe,
for never has bird sung so sweetly as the gifted subject of my memoir,
and while the Fates smiled on the birth of their favorite, destined to
become the unrivalled Queen of Song throughout the civilized world,
fanciful natures might conceive a poetical vision, and behold Melpomene
with her sad, grave eyes breathing into her the spirit of tragedy, and
Thalia, with her laughing smile, welcoming a gifted disciple by whose
genius her fire was to be rekindled in the far future.</p>

<p>In the year 1861 there arrived in England a young singer who,
accompanied by her brother-in-law, took apartments in Norfolk Street,
Strand. The young lady, then only seventeen, sought Mr. Frederick Gye,
who was the lessee of the Royal Italian Opera, for his permission to
sing at his theatre, volunteering to do so <i>for nothing</i>. The offer was
at first absolutely declined, but subsequently the young artiste
succeeded, and made her first appearance on May 14, 1861, as Amina in
Bellini's opera of "La Sonnambula." Unheralded by any previous notice,
she was then totally unknown to the English public. Not a syllable had
reached that country of her antecedents or fame. I remember being
present on the occasion when this youthful cantatrice tripped lightly on
to the centre of the stage. Not a single hand was raised to greet her,
nor a sound of welcome extended to encourage the young artiste. The
audience of Covent Garden, usually reserved, except to old-established
favorites, seemed wrapped in more than their conventional coldness on
that particular evening. Ere long, however, indeed before she had
finished the opening aria, a change manifested itself in the feelings of
all present. The <i>habitués</i> looked round in astonishment, and people
near me almost held their breath in amazement. The second act followed,
and to surprise quickly succeeded delight, for when in the third act she
threw all her vocal and dramatic power into the melodious wailing of
"<i>Ah non credea</i>," with its brilliant sequel, "<i>Ah non giunge</i>," the
enthusiasm of the audience forgot all restriction, and burst into a
spontaneous shout of applause, the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page379" name="page379"></a>(p. 379)</span> pent-up fervor of the
assembly exploding in a ringing cheer of acclamation rarely heard within
the walls of the Royal Italian Opera House. The heroine of the evening
was Adelina Patti, who thenceforward became the idol of the musical
world. When I left the theatre that evening, I became conscious that a
course of fascination had commenced of a most unwonted nature; one that
neither time nor change has modified, but which three decades have
served only to enhance and intensify.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the performance, Mr. Gye went on to the stage full
of the excitement which prevailed in the theatre, and he immediately
concluded an engagement with Mlle. Patti on the terms which had been
previously agreed between them; these being that Mlle. Patti was to
receive at the rate of <i>£</i>150 a month for three years, appearing twice
each week during the season, or at the rate of about <i>£</i>17 for each
performance. Mr. Gye also offered her the sum of <i>£</i>200 if she would
consent to sing exclusively at Covent Garden.</p>

<p>Patti repeated her performance of Amina eight times during the season,
and subsequently confirmed her success by her assumption of Lucia,
Violetta, Zerlina, Martha, and Rosina.</p>

<p>Having met with such unprecedented success throughout the London season,
Mlle. Patti was offered an engagement to sing at the Italian Opera in
Paris, where unusual curiosity was awakened concerning her. Everyone is
aware that the Parisians do not admit an artist to be a celebrity until
they have themselves acknowledged it. At Paris, after the first act, the
sensation was indescribable, musicians, ministers, poets, and
fashionable beauties all concurring in the general chorus of
acclamation; while the genial Auber, the composer of so many delightful
operas, and one of the greatest authorities, by his experience and
judgment, on all musical matters, was so enchanted that he declared she
had made him young again, and for several days he could scarcely talk on
any other subject but Adelina Patti and opera. The conquest she had
achieved with the English public was thus triumphantly ratified by the
exacting and critical members of musical society in Paris.</p>

<p>Adèle Juan Maria Patti, according to her own statement, which she
related to the Queen Isabella of Spain, was born at Madrid, on February
19, 1843, and is the youngest daughter of two famous Italian singers,
Signor Salvatore Patti and Signora Patti-Barili. The signor having
placed her two sisters&mdash;Amalia, who subsequently married Maurice
Strakosch, the well-known impresario, and Carlotta, also a vocalist of
remarkable powers&mdash;in a boarding-school at Milan, went to New York with
his wife and daughter, where they remained until Adelina reached
sixteen.</p>

<p>Adelina Patti had barely reached the age of three years when she was
heard humming and singing the airs her mother sang.</p>

<p>The child's voice was naturally so flexible that executive difficulties
were always easy to her, and, before she had attained her ninth year she
could execute a prolonged shake with fluency. Her father not being
prosperous at the time, it became a necessity for him to look for
support to his little Adelina, who had shown <span class="pagenum"><a id="page380" name="page380"></a>(p. 380)</span> such remarkable
promise; and, accordingly, she began to take singing lessons&mdash;not, as is
stated in Grove's "Dictionary of Musicians," from Maurice Strakosch, but
from a French lady, subsequently studying with her step-brother, Ettore
Barili, who was a famous baritone singer; but nature had been so
prodigal of her gifts to the child that she never undertook a serious
course of study, but, as she herself says, her real master was "le bon
Dieu." At a very early age she would sing and play the part of Norma,
and knew the whole of the words and music of Rosina, the heroine of
Rossini's immortal "Il Barbiere di Seviglia." She sang at various
concerts in different cities, until she reached the age of twelve and a
half, when her career was temporarily interrupted, for Maurice
Strakosch, observing the ruinous effect the continuous strain upon her
delicate voice was working, insisted upon her discontinuing singing
altogether, which advice she happily followed. After this interval of
two years' silence, and having emerged from the wonder-child to the
young artiste, she recommenced her studies under M. Strakosch, and very
soon afterward was engaged to sing on a regular stage. Strakosch
travelled with her and Gottschalk, the pianist, through the United
States, during the tour giving a number of concerts with varying
financial results; ultimately returning to New York in 1859, where she
appeared at a concert of which <i>The New York Herald</i> of November 28th
gives the following notice: "One of the most remarkable events in the
operatic history of the metropolis, or even of the world, has taken
place during the last week at the Academy of Music. Mlle. Patti sang the
mad scene from Lucia in such a superb manner as to stir up the audience
to the heartiest demonstrations of delight. The success of this artiste,
educated and reared among us, has made everybody talk of her." In the
following year, Strakosch considered the time had arrived for her to
appear in Europe. He accordingly brought his young protégée to England,
with the result I have already attempted to describe.</p>

<p>After singing in London and Paris, Patti was engaged to appear at
Berlin, Brussels, Moscow, and St. Petersburg, at which latter city
enthusiasm reached its climax, when on one occasion she was called
before the curtain no fewer than forty times. One who was with her there
during her last visit, writes: "Having been witness of Adelina's many
triumphs and of outbursts of enthusiasm bordering upon madness, I did
not think that greater demonstrations were possible. I was profoundly
mistaken, however, for the St. Petersburg public far surpassed anything
I have seen before. On Adelina's nights extraordinary profits were made.
Places for the gallery were sold for ten roubles each, while stalls were
quickly disposed of for a hundred roubles each. The emperor and empress,
with the whole court, took part in the brilliant reception accorded to
Patti, and flowers to the amount of six thousand roubles were thrown at
her."</p>

<p>That she has been literally worshipped from infancy upward is only a
natural consequence of her unsurpassable gifts, and nowhere has this
feeling manifested itself to such an extent as in Paris, and by none
more so than by the four famous composers, Auber, Meyerbeer, Rossini,
and Gounod. Auber, after hearing her sing Norina, in Donizetti's "Don
Pasquale," offered her a bouquet of roses from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page381" name="page381"></a>(p. 381)</span> Normandy, and in
answer to her questions about her diamonds, said, "The diamonds you wear
are beautiful indeed, but those you place in our ears are a thousand
times better." Patti was the pet of the gifted composer of "Guillaume
Tell," and no one was ever more welcome at Rossini's beautiful villa at
Passy, well known as the centre of a great musical and artistic circle.
The genial Italian died in November, 1868, and Patti paid her last
tribute of respect to his memory by taking part in the performance of
his immortal "Stabat Mater," which was given on the occasion of
Rossini's burial service.</p>

<p>Gounod, always enthusiastic in his remarks upon her, said, "that until
he heard Patti, all the Marguerites were Northern maidens, but Patti was
the only Southern Gretchen, and that from her all future singers could
learn what to do and avoid."</p>

<p>Although it is not the custom to bestow titles or honorific distinctions
upon artists of the fair sex, yet, in lieu of these, to such an extent
have presents been showered upon Adelina Patti, that the jewels which
she has been presented with from time to time are said to be of the
enormous value of <i>£</i>100,000. In the year 1885, when she appeared in New
York as Violetta, the diamonds she wore on that occasion were estimated
to be worth <i>£</i>60,000. One of the handsomest lockets in her possession
is a present from Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, and a splendid solitaire
ring which she is in the habit of wearing was given to her by the
Baroness Burdett-Coutts. Of no less than twenty-three valuable
bracelets, one of the most costly is that presented by the committee of
the Birmingham festival. A magnificent comb, set with twenty-three large
diamonds, is the gift of the Empress Eugénie. The emperors of Germany,
Austria, and Russia have vied with each other in sending her jewels of
the rarest value.</p>

<p>When singing in Italy, King Victor Emmanuel each night visited the opera
for the purpose of hearing her; and at Florence, where the enthusiastic
Italians applauded to the very echo, Mario, prince of Italian tenors,
leaned from his box to crown her with a laurel wreath. A similar honor
was bestowed upon her by the Duke of Alba at Madrid, who presented her
with a laurel crown. At the opera house in that city numbers of bouquets
and poems were to be seen whirling through the air attached to the necks
of birds. Queen Isabella of Spain, gave a large amethyst brooch
surrounded by forty enormous pearls, and the Jockey Club of Paris
presented her with twelve laurel crowns. The citizens of San Francisco,
upon the occasion of her last visit, presented her with a five-pointed
star formed of thirty large brilliants, and from the Queen of Portugal
she received a massive locket containing Her Majesty's portrait,
enriched by an enormous oriental pearl encrusted in brilliants; and even
at the present time scarcely a day passes without the "Diva" receiving
some acknowledgment in recognition of her transcendent powers.</p>

<p>Adelina Patti's first husband was Henri, Marquis de Caux, an equerry to
the Empress Eugénie, from whom she was separated and subsequently
divorced; and, on June 10, 1886, she married Ernesto Nicolini, the
famous tenor singer.</p>

<p>In appearance, Patti is still youthful, and really seems destined to
rival the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page382" name="page382"></a>(p. 382)</span> celebrated French beauty, Ninon de l'Enclos, who was
so beautiful at sixty that the grandsons of the men who loved her in her
youth adored her with equal ardor. Patti's figure is still slim and
rounded, and not a wrinkle as yet is to be seen on her cheeks, or a line
about her eyes, which are as clear and bright as ever, and which, when
she speaks to you, look you straight in the face with her old winning
smile.</p>

<p>During her career Patti has earned upward of half a million sterling,
and the enormous sums paid to her at the present time more than double
the amounts which Jenny Lind received, and which in that day were
regarded as fabulous.</p>

<p>On a natural plateau, surrounded by picturesque vales, and situated in
the heart of the very wildest and most romantic part of South Wales,
between Brecon and Swansea, and at the base of the Rock of the Night,
stands the Castle of Craig-y-nos. This is the nightingale's nest. The
princely fortune which Patti has accumulated has enabled her so to
beautify and enlarge her home, that it now contains all the luxuries
which Science and Art have enabled Fortune's favorites to enjoy; and so
crowded is it with curios and valuables that it may best be described as
"the home of all Art yields or Nature can decree."</p>

<p>Here, in picturesque seclusion, surrounded by a unique splendor created
by her own exertions, lives this gifted and beautiful songstress. She is
the "Lady Bountiful" of the entire district, extending many miles around
the castle, over which she presides with such hospitable grace. The
number of grateful hearts she has won in the Welsh country by her active
benevolence is almost as great as is the legion of enthusiastic admirers
she has enlisted by the wonderful beauty of her voice and the series of
artistic triumphs, which have been absolutely without parallel during
the present century.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>




<h3>SARAH BERNHARDT<br>

By <span class="smcap">H. S. Edwards</span><br>

(BORN 1844)</h3>

<p>A little girl, as Sarcey relates, once presented herself at the Paris
Conservatoire in order to pass the examination for admission. All she
knew was the fable of the "Two Pigeons," but she had no sooner recited
the lines&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem30">
<span class="min03em">"</span>Deux pigeons s'aimaient d'amour tendre,<br>
  L'un d'eux, s'ennuyant au logis"&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">than Auber stopped her with a gesture. "Enough," he said. "Come here, my
child." The little girl, who was pale and thin, but whose eyes gleamed
with intelligence, approached him with an air of assurance. "Your name
is Sarah?" he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page383" name="page383"></a>(p. 383)</span> "Yes, sir." was the reply.</p>

<p>"You are a Jewess?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, by birth; but I have been baptized."</p>

<p>"She has been baptized," said Auber, turning to his colleagues. "It
would have been a pity if such a pretty child had not. She said her
fable of the 'Two Pigeons' very well. She must be admitted."</p>

<a id="img059" name="img059"></a>
<div class="floatright">
<img src="images/img059.jpg" width="200" height="225" alt="Sarah Bernhardt." title="">
</div>

<p>Thus Sarah Bernhardt, for it was she, entered the Conservatoire. She was
a Jewess of French and Dutch parentage, and was born at Paris in 1844.
Her father, after having her baptized, had placed her in a convent; but
she had already secretly determined to become an actress. In her course
of study at the Conservatoire she so distinguished herself that she
received a prize which entitled her to a <i>début</i> at the Théâtre
Français. She selected the part of Iphigénie, in which she appeared on
August 11, 1862; and at least one newspaper drew special attention to
her performance, describing her as "pretty and elegant," and
particularly praising her perfect enunciation. She afterward played
other parts at the Théâtre Français, but soon transferred herself from
that house to the Gymnase, though not until she had made herself
notorious by having, as was alleged, slapped the face of a
sister-actress in a fit of temper.</p>

<p>The director of the Gymnase did not take too serious a view of his new
actress, who turned up late at rehearsals, and sometimes did not turn up
at all. Nor did her acting make any great impression at the Gymnase,
where, it is true, she was only permitted to appear on Sundays. At this
theatre she lost no time in exhibiting that independence and caprice to
which, as much as to her talent, she owes her celebrity. The day after
the first representation of a piece by Labiche, "Un Mari qui Lance sa
Femme," in which she had undertaken an important part, she stealthily
quitted Paris, addressing to the author a letter in which she begged him
to forgive her.</p>

<p>After a tour in Spain, Sarah returned to Paris, and appeared at the
Odéon. Here she created a certain number of characters, in such plays as
"Les Arrêts," "Le Drame de la Rue de la Paix," and "Le Bâtard," but
chiefly distinguished herself in "Ruy Blas," and in a translation of
"King Lear." Already she had riveted the attention of the public and the
press, who saw that a brilliant future lay before her.</p>

<p>At the end of 1872 she appeared at the Comédie Française, and with such
distinction that she was retained, first as a pensionnaire, at a salary
of six thousand francs, and afterward as a <i>sociétaire</i>. Her successes
were rapid and dazzling, and whether she appeared in modern comedy, in
classic tragedy, or as the creator of characters in entirely new plays,
the theatre was always crowded. Her melodious voice and pure
enunciation, her singularly varied accents, her pathos, her ardent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page384" name="page384"></a>(p. 384)</span> bursts of passion, were such that her audience, as they hung
upon her lips, forgot the caprices and eccentricities by which she was
already characterized in private life. It seemed, however, that Sarah's
ambition was to gain personal notoriety even more than theatrical fame;
and by her performances of one kind or another outside the theatre make
herself the talk of society. She affected to paint, to chisel, and to
write; sent pictures to the Salon, published eccentric books, and
exhibited busts. She would receive her friends palette in hand, and in
the dress of a male artist. She had a luxurious coffin made for her,
covered with velvet, in which she loved to recline; and she more than
once went up in a balloon.</p>

<p>Her caprice, whether in private or public, was altogether unrestrained.
In 1880 Émile Augier's admirable comedy, "L'Aventurière," was revived at
the Comédie Française, and the author confided the part of Clorinde to
Sarah Bernhardt. After the first representation, however, she was so
enraged by an uncomplimentary newspaper criticism that she sent in her
resignation to M. Émile Perrin, director of the theatre, quitted Paris,
and went to England, where she gave a series of representations, and,
appearing there for the first time, caused a veritable sensation in
London society. Meanwhile, M. Perrin instituted against her, in the name
of the Comédie Française, a lawsuit for breach of contract, with damages
laid at three hundred thousand francs. It was at this juncture that
Sarah accepted the offers of an enterprising manager for a tour in
America, where she achieved no less phenomenal successes than in Europe.</p>

<p>A sensational account of this American tour was afterward published by
one of her associates, Mlle. Marie Colombier, under the title of "Sarah
Bernhardt en Amérique." This was followed by a second volume from the
same pen, entitled "Sarah Barnum." The latter book, as its title
suggests, was not intended as a compliment; and Sarah Bernhardt brought
an action against the writer, by which she was compelled to expunge from
her scandalous volume all that was offensive.</p>

<p>The rest of Sarah's career is too recent to be traced in detail. Nor can
the life of an actress of our own time be dealt with so freely as that
of a Sophie Arnould or an Adrienne Lecouvreur.</p>

<p>From America Sarah returned to Paris, where she revived all her old
successes, and where, in 1888, at the Odéon, she produced a one-act
comedy from her own pen, entitled "L'Aveu," which met with a somewhat
frigid reception. She has appeared in several of Shakespeare's plays
with great success, but her most ambitious and perhaps most admirable
productions of late years have been her Cleopatra, first produced in
Paris in 1890, and her Joan of Arc.</p>

<p>Among her numerous eccentricities, Mlle. Bernhardt once got married;
London, by reason of the facilities it affords for this species of
recreation, being chosen as the scene of the espousals. The hero of the
matrimonial comedy, which was soon followed by a separation, to which,
after many adventures on the part of both husband and wife, a
reconciliation succeeded, was M. Damala, a Greek gentleman, possessed
of considerable histrionic talent, who died in 1880.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>
